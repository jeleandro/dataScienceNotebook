abstract={Well-established automatic analyses of texts mainly consider frequencies of linguistic units, e.g. letters, words, and bigrams. In a recent, alternative approach, medium and large-scale text structures were used in opposition to the belief that text structure is dominated by the language features. In this paper, we introduce a generalized similarity measure to compare texts which accounts for both the network structure of texts and the role of individual words in the networks. The similarity measure is used for authorship attribution of three collections of books, each composed of 8 authors and 10 books per author. High accuracy rates were obtained with typical values between 90% and 98.75%, much higher than with the traditional term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) approach for the same collections. These accuracies are also higher than those obtained solely with the topology of networks. We conclude that the different properties of specific words on the macroscopic scale structure of a whole text are as relevant as their frequency of appearance; conversely, considering the identity of nodes brings further knowledge about a piece of text represented as a network. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Text genre classification is the process of identifying functional characteristics of text documents. The immense quantity of text documents available on the web can be properly filtered, organised and retrieved with the use of text genre classification, which may have potential use on several other tasks of natural language processing and information retrieval. Genre may refer to several aspects of text documents, such as function and purpose. The language function analysis (LFA) concentrates on single aspect of genres and it aims to classify text documents into three abstract classes, such as expressive, appellative and informative. Text genre classification is typically performed by supervised machine learning algorithms. The extraction of an efficient feature set to represent text documents is an essential task for building a robust classification scheme with high predictive performance. In addition, ensemble learning, which combines the outputs of individual classifiers to obtain a robust classification scheme, is a promising research field in machine learning research. In this regard, this article presents an extensive comparative analysis of different feature engineering schemes (such as features used in authorship attribution, linguistic features, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words) and five different base learners (Naïve Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour and Random Forest) in conjunction with ensemble learning methods (such as Boosting, Bagging and Random Subspace). Based on the empirical analysis, an ensemble classification scheme is presented, which integrates Random Subspace ensemble of Random Forest with four types of features (features used in authorship attribution, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words). For LFA corpus, the highest average predictive performance obtained by the proposed scheme is 94.43%. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Recently, document embeddings methods have been proposed aiming at capturing hidden properties of the texts. These methods allow to represent documents in terms of fixed-length, continuous and dense feature vectors. In this paper, we propose to learn document vectors based on n-grams and not only on words. We use the recently proposed Paragraph Vector method. These n-grams include character n-grams, word n-grams and n-grams of POS tags (in all cases with n varying from 1 to 5). We considered the task of Cross-Topic Authorship Attribution and made experiments on The Guardian corpus.

abstract={Identification of the key environmental indicators (KEIs) from a large number of environmental variables is important for environmental management in tidal flat reclamation areas. In this study, a modified principal component analysis approach (MPCA) has been developed for determining the KEIs. The MPCA accounts for the two important attributes of the environmental variables: pollution status and temporal variation, in addition to the commonly considered numerical divergence attribute. It also incorporates the distance correlation (dCor) to replace the Pearson's correlation to measure the nonlinear interrelationship between the variables. The proposed method was applied to the Tiaozini sand shoal, a large-scale tidal flat reclamation region in China. Five KEIs were identified as dissolved inorganic nitrogen, Cd, petroleum in the water column, Hg, and total organic carbon in the sediment. The identified KEIs were shown to respond well to the biodiversity of phytoplankton. This demonstrated that the identified KEIs adequately represent the environmental condition in the coastal marine system. Therefore, the MPCA is a practicable method for extracting effective indicators that have key roles in the coastal and marine environment. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={In authorship attribution domain single classifiers are often employed in research as elements of decision system. On the other hand, there is intuitive prediction that the use of multiple classifier with fusion of their outcomes may improve the quality of the investigated system. Additionally, discretization can be applied for input data which can be beneficial for the classification accuracy. The paper presents performance analysis of some multiple classifiers basing on the majority voting rule. Ensembles were composed from eight single well known classifiers. Influence of different discretization methods on the quality of the analyzed systems was also investigated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

abstract={Ranking is a strategy widely used for estimating relevance or importance of available characteristic features. Depending on the applied methodology, variables are assessed individually or as subsets, by some statistics referring to information theory, machine learning algorithms, or specialised procedures that execute systematic search through the feature space. The information about importance of attributes can be used in the pre-processing step of initial data preparation, to remove irrelevant or superfluous elements. It can also be employed in post-processing, for optimisation of already constructed classifiers. The chapter describes research on the latter approach, involving filtering inferred decision rules while exploiting ranking positions and scores of features. The optimised rule classifiers were applied in the domain of stylometric analysis of texts for the task of binary authorship attribution. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Attribution of the panel The Virgin with the Child and an Angel today in the Art Museum of Girona is under study due to the existence of two hypotheses, both of them not thoroughly documented, pointing Jan Massys and Bernardo Luini as potential authors. Attribution process is an important issue in many museums and collections. In this article, the question is addressed by combining material and iconographic information, paying special attention to the information yielded by minor components, and by following the material characteristics of the existing restoration interventions. In addition to imaging and classical analytical techniques (SEM and FTIR), the capability of a new developed Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry system for minor elements and thin layers detection is also discussed. Results confirmed a 16th century palette and revealed the use of specific pigments such as Verditer and Smalt. Analytical results combined with iconographic characteristics, permitted the contextualization of the painting in North Europe in the circle of production of Antwerp between 1500–1550. This conclusion does not allow the direct attribution to Jan Massys but minimize the probabilities of Bernadino Luini as author. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={The authorship identification will determine the likelihood of the writing produced, by an author, by means of examining the other writings. The rapid proliferation of technologies along with the applications of the internet, the misuse of online messages for the purpose of inappropriate or for illegal reasons is a major concern in society. The online message distribution and its anonymous nature will make the identity of tracing anyone of critical issue. The work has been developed using a framework for the identification of authorship of the online messages for addressing as well as tracing such problems. For this framework, identification of authorship is done by the four writing style features (the lexical, the syntactic, the structural, and the n-gram features) that are extracted and inductive learning algorithms have been used for building a feature based classification model for the identification of the authorship of the online messages. For this work, the C4.5, the fuzzy and also the Ada boost classifiers will be used for the task of authorship-identification. An experimental study on this framework with the effects of these classification techniques on online messages is evaluated. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Sentiment analysis is becoming increasingly important mainly because of the growth of web comments. Sentiment polarity classification is a popular process in this field. Writing style features, such as lexical and word-based features, are often used in the authorship identification and gender classification of online messages. However, writing style features were only used in feature selection for sentiment classification. This research presents an exploratory study of the group characteristics of writing style features on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) movie sentiment data set. Furthermore, this study utilizes the specific group characteristics of writing style in improving the performance of sentiment classification. We determine the optimum clustering number of user reviews based on writing style features distribution. According to the classification model trained on a training subset with specific writing style clustering tags, we determine that the model trained on the data set of a specific writing style group has an optimal effect on the classification accuracy, which is better than the model trained on the entire data set in a particular positive or negative polarity. Through the polarity characteristics of specific writing style groups, we propose a general model in improving the performance of the existing classification approach. Results of the experiments on sentiment classification using the IMDb data set demonstrate that the proposed model improves the performance in terms of classification accuracy. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous pest indigenous throughout the Americas, which recently appeared in Africa, first reported from São Tomé, Nigeria, Bénin and Togo in 2016, and which we now report from Ghana. This species is recognised to comprise two morphologically identical but genetically distinct strains or species in the Americas, and we found both to be present in Ghana. We discuss possible routes of entry to Africa, of which the likeliest is adults and/or egg masses transported on direct commercial flights between the Americas and West Africa, followed by dispersal by adult flight within Africa. Identification of Lepidoptera is normally based on the markings and morphology of adults, and not on the larvae which actually cause the damage, and therefore larvae have to be reared through to adult for authoritative identification. We confirmed that the use of DNA barcoding allowed unequivocal identification of this new pest from Ghana based on the larvae alone. As authenticated barcodes for vouchered specimens of more pests become available, this approach has the potential to become a valuable in-country tool to support national capability in rapid and reliable pest diagnosis and identification. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic n-grams, latent Dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, distributed memory model of paragraph vectors, distributed bag of words version of paragraph vector, word2vec representations, and other baselines.

abstract={This paper reports comparative authorship attribution results obtained on the Internet comments of the morphologically complex Lithuanian language. We have explored the impact of machine learning and similarity-based approaches on the different author set sizes (containing 10, 100, and 1,000 candidate authors), feature types (lexical, morphological, and character), and feature selection techniques (feature ranking, random selection). The authorship attribution task was complicated due to the used Lithuanian language characteristics, nonnormative texts, an extreme shortness of these texts, and a large number of candidate authors. The best results were achieved with the machine learning approaches. On the larger author sets the entire feature set composed of word-level character tetra-grams demonstrated the best performance. © 2017 PTI.},

abstract={Internet can be misused by cyber criminals as a platform to conduct illegitimate activities (such as harassment, cyber bullying, and incitement of hate or violence) anonymously. As a result, authorship analysis of anonymous texts in Internet (such as emails, forum comments) has attracted significant attention in the digital forensic and text mining communities. The main problem is a large number of possible of authors, which hinders the effective identification of a true author. We interpret open class author attribution as a process of expert recommendation where the decision support system returns a list of suspected authors for further analysis by forensics experts rather than a single prediction result, thus reducing the scale of the problem. We describe the task formally and present algorithms for constructing the suspected author list. For evaluation we propose using a simple Winner-Takes-All (WTA) metric as well as a set of gain-discount model based metrics from the information retrieval domain (mean reciprocal rank, discounted cumulative gain and rank-biased precision). We also propose the List Precision (LP) metric as an extension of WTA for evaluating the usability of the suspected author list. For experiments, we use our own dataset of Internet comments in Lithuanian language and consider the use of language-specific (Lithuanian) lexical features together with general lexical features derived from English language. For classification we use one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results of experiments show that the usability of open class author attribution can be improved considerably by using a set of language-specific lexical features together with general lexical features, while the proposed method can be used to reduce the number of suspected authors thus alleviating the work of forensic linguists. © 2017 PTI.},

abstract={The authors propose, design, and implement a low-cost universal smart energy meter (USEM) with demand-side load management. The meter can be used in the postpaid and prepaid modes with flexible tariffplans such as time of use, block rate tariff, and their combination. The smart meter comprises of a potential transformer, current transformer, and microcontroller unit with an embedded communication module. The connectivity among the utility authority, the smart meter, and consumer is established by authority identification number, meter identification number, and user identification number using the cellular network. The load management option of the meter controls electrical loads and provides emergency power during the power shortage. The USEM can be configured and reconfigured remotely simply by short message service without changing hardware. Besides, energy consumption status, meter tampering, and fault at the distribution end can be monitored with the proposed metering system. Here, a prototype of the smart meter is presented, and its effectiveness, flexibility, and versatility are experimentally demonstrated. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={The analysis of authorial style, termed stylometry, assumes that style is quantifiably measurable for evaluation of distinctive qualities. Stylometry research has yielded several methods and tools over the past 200 years to handle a variety of challenging cases. This survey reviews several articles within five prominent subtasks: Authorship attribution, authorship verification, authorship profiling, stylochronometry, and adversarial stylometry. Discussions on datasets, features, experimental techniques, and recent approaches are provided. Further, a current research challenge lies in the inability of authorship analysis techniques to scale to a large number of authors with few text samples. Here, we perform an extensive performance analysis on a corpus of 1,000 authors to investigate authorship attribution, verification, and clustering using 14 algorithms from the literature. Finally, several remaining research challenges are discussed, along with descriptions of various open-source and commercial software that may be useful for stylometry subtasks. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This paper makes the case for stronger engagement of libraries and consortia when it comes to negotiating and drafting offsetting agreements. Two workshops organized by the Efficiencies and Standards for Article Charges (ESAC) initiative in 2016 and 2017 have shown a clear need for an improvement of the current workflows and processes between academic institutions (and libraries) and the publishers they use in terms of author identification, metadata exchange and invoicing. Publishers need to invest in their editorial systems, while institutions need to get a clearer understanding of the strategic goal of offsetting. To this purpose, strategic and practical elements, which should be included in the agreements, will be introduced. Firstly, the Joint Understanding of Offsetting, launched in 2016, will be discussed. This introduces the 'pay-As-you-publish' model as a transitional pathway for the agreements. Secondly, this paper proposes a set of recommendations for article workflows and services between institutions and publishers, based on a draft document which was produced as part of the 2nd ESAC Offsetting Workshop in March 2017. These recommendations should be seen as a minimum set of practical and formal requirements for offsetting agreements and are necessary to make any publication-based open access business model work.},

abstract={Astroturfing is appearing in numerous contexts in social media, with individuals posting product reviews or political commentary under a number of different names, and is of concern because of the intended deception. An astroturfer works with the aim of making it seem that a large number of people hold the same opinion, promoting a consensus based on the astroturfer's intentions. It is generally done for commercial or political advantage, often by paid writers or ideologically motivated writers. This paper brings the notion of authorship attribution to bear on the astroturfing problem, collecting quantities of data from public social media sites and analyzing the putative individual authors to see if they appear to be the same person. The analysis comprises a binary n-gram method, which was previously shown to be effective at accurately identifying authors on a training set from the same authors, while this paper shows how authors on different social media turn out to be the same author. The method has identified numerous instances where multiple accounts are apparently being operated by a single individual. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={The efficacy of syntactic features for topic-independent authorship attribution is evaluated, taking a feature set of frequencies of words and punctuation marks as baseline. The features are 'deep' in the sense that they are derived by parsing the subject texts, in contrast to 'shallow' syntactic features for which a part-of-speech analysis is enough. The experiments are made on two corpora of online texts and one corpus of novels written around the year 1900. The classification tasks include classical closed-world authorship attribution, identification of separate texts among the works of one author, and cross-topic authorship attribution. In the first tasks, the feature sets were fairly evenly matched, but for the last task, the syntax-based feature set outperformed the baseline feature set. These results suggest that, compared to lexical features, syntactic features are more robust to changes in topic. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.},

abstract={Compression models represent an interesting approach for different classification tasks and have been used widely across many research fields. We adapt compression models to the field of authorship verification (AV), a branch of digital text forensics. The task in AV is to verify if a questioned document and a reference document of a known author are written by the same person. We propose an intrinsic AV method, which yields competitive results compared to a number of current state-of-the-art approaches, based on support vector machines or neural networks. However, in contrast to these approaches our method does not make use of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing techniques, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization or external documents (a common strategy to transform AV from a one-class to a multi-class classification problem). Instead, the only three key components of our method are a compressing algorithm, a dissimilarity measure and a threshold, needed to accept or reject the authorship of the questioned document. Due to its compactness, our method performs very fast and can be reimplemented with minimal effort. In addition, the method can handle complicated AV cases where both, the questioned and the reference document, are not related to each other in terms of topic or genre. We evaluated our approach against publicly available datasets, which were used in three international AV competitions. Furthermore, we constructed our own corpora, where we evaluated our method against state-of-the-art approaches and achieved, in both cases, promising results. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Identification of the most significant factors for evaluating road risk level is an important question in road safety research, predominantly for decision-making processes. However, model selection for this specific purpose is the most relevant focus in current research. In this paper, we proposed a new methodological approach for road safety risk evaluation, which is a two-stage framework consisting of data envelopment analysis (DEA) in combination with artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the first phase, the risk level of the road segments under study was calculated by applying DEA, and high-risk segments were identified. Then, the ANNs technique was adopted in the second phase, which appears to be a valuable analytical tool for risk prediction. The practical application of DEA-ANN approach within the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment will be an efficient approach for road safety risk analysis. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Different data mining techniques are employed in stylometry domain for performing authorship attribution tasks. Sometimes to improve the decision system the discretization of input data can be applied. In many cases such approach allows to obtain better classification results. On the other hand, there were situations in which discretization decreased overall performance of the system. Therefore, the question arose what would be the result if only some selected attributes were discretized. The paper presents the results of the research performed for forward sequential selection of attributes to be discretized. The influence of such approach on the performance of the decision system, based on Naive Bayes classifier in authorship attribution domain, is presented. Some basic discretization methods and different approaches to discretization of the test datasets are taken into consideration. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of deep belief networks for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA). The proposed approach uses Gaussian units in the visible layer to model real-valued data on the basis of a Gaussian-Bernoulli deep belief network. The lexical, syntactic, and application-specific features are explored, leading to the proposal of a method to merge a pair of features into a single one. The CA is simulated by decomposing an online document into a sequence of short texts over which the CA decisions happen. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method uses block sizes of 140, 280, 500 characters, on the basis of the Twitter and Enron e-mail corpuses. Promising results are obtained, which consist of an equal error rate varying from 8.21% to 16.73%. Using relatively smaller forgery samples, an equal error rate varying from 5.48% to 12.3% is also obtained for different block sizes. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={One of the most shared content in Social Media (SM) is text, making it vulnerable to copy and authorship misappropriation. Due to the low data noise, watermark embedding is very hard. This problem is exacerbated in the context of SM, where the amount of data in a single message can be extremely small, like in Twitter. Firstly, in this paper we investigate whether SM do applies watermarks on the texts. Then, we propose a text watermarking method able to work on all the SM platforms considered, while ensuring visual indistinguishability and length preservation of the original text and robustness to copy and paste. We conduct an extended evaluation on eighteen different SM platforms by using 6,000 posts from six public figures’ profiles. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Biometrics is the science and technology that involves the measurement and analysis of the human body’s biological data. Biometrics involves the extraction a feature set from the obtained data. The feature set is then compared against the template set stored the database. Identification of people must demonstrate reliability and accurately especially in the domains of business transactions and in the access to confidential information. The currently available fingerprint biometric Identification concentrates on feature extraction and task of classification for authorship identification. In fingerprint, the random representation may cause degradation to the performance of classification. Thus, prior to the classification task, certain standards should be present to denote these unique features. In relation to this, the application of the discretization technique would be beneficial. Hence, a new framework for fingerprint biometric identification is proposed. This paper particularly shows the outcome of discretization process on fingerprint samples to attain individual identification. In this paper, the new proposed framework and classic framework were compared using samples. Based on the results, classification accuracies of 90% were obtained when using discretization process with fingerprint biometric identification. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.},

The proposed model is based on a distance measure called Spatium derived from the Canberra measure (weighted version of L1 norm). The selected features consist of the 200 most frequent words and punctuation symbols. An evaluation methodology is presented and the test collections are extracted from the PAN CLEF 2016 evaluation campaign. In addition to those, we also consider two additional corpora reflecting the literature domain more closely. Based on four different languages, the evaluation measures demonstrate a high precision and F1 for all 20 test collections. A more detailed analysis provides reasons explaining some of the failures of the Spatium model. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={To avoid the existing defects of author identification, this paper proposes an authorship identification model which combines non-schema attribute similarity feature extraction with SVM (Support Vector Machine). Based on the coefficient (Dice), the model extended it to the continuous feature similarity of dual character. To avoid the differences of attribute characteristics among different platforms, the non-schema attribute similarity method is adopted to calculate the similarities among various authors. Finally, the average value is taken as the final similarity eigenvalue. In the training process of the SVM model, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of SVM mode before the actual data is tested. The results show that the model of the algorithm proposed in this paper avoids the isomerism of information attributes among different authors. Compared with the traditional method which identifies the authorship through feature AV, the new algorithm enhanced over 10% from the perspective of the recall and accuracy rate.},

abstract={We propose a new methodology for testing whether two writing samples were written by the same author. While many such tests are based on an index of lexical richness, we propose to use an entire profile of such indices. Specifically, we evaluate a profile of generalized Simpson’s indices for two writing samples and see if the profiles are significantly different or not. We validate our methodology on several poems whose authorship is known. We then apply it to test whether the poem ‘Shall I Die?’ which is sometimes attributed to William Shakespeare was, in fact, written by him. Further, we provide R code and a package for R that easily implements this methodology. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Automated authorship attribution is actual to identify the author of an anonymous texts, or texts whose authorship is in doubt. It can be used in various applications including author verification, plagiarism detection, computer forensics and others. In this article, the authors analyze an approach based on frequency combination of letters is investigated for solving such a task as classification of documents by authorship. This technique could be used to identify the author of a computer program from a predefined set of possible authors. The effectiveness of this approach is significantly determined by the choice of metric. The research examines and compares four different distance measures between a text of unknown authorship and an authors' profile: L1 measure, Kullback-Leibler divergence, base metric of Common N-gram method (CNG) and a certain variation of dissimilarity measure of CNG method. Comparison outlines cases when some metric outperforms others with a specific parameter combination. Experiments are conducted on different Russian and English corpora.

abstract={Identification of costs drivers and their influence level on building development costs play a key role in the development of construction models and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of any project. Forty-five indicators influencing building development costs in New Zealand are explored by literature review and pilot interviews. These indicators are grouped into seven categories. The determination and ranking of the cost drivers are carried out by a questionnaire survey distributed to key professionals working in New Zealand's construction industry. Structural equation modeling (SEM) software was employed for analysis of the collected data. One of the key advantages of this powerful software is to provide the p-value according to the structure of the research model. Findings of this study indicate that the property market and construction industry factor, statutory and regulatory factor, and socio-economic factors are major factors affecting building development costs in New Zealand. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan regarding the Christians is a crucial subject for the studies on early Christianity. A serious quarrel among scholars concerning its genuineness arose between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th; per contra, Plinian authorship has not been seriously questioned in the last few decades. After analysing various kinds of internal and external evidence in favour of and against the authenticity of the letter, a modern stylometric method is applied in order to examine whether internal linguistic evidence allows one to definitely settle the debate.The findings of this analysis tend to contradict received opinion among modern scholars, affirming the authenticity of Pliny's letter, and suggest instead the presence of large amounts of interpolation inside the text of the letter, since its stylistic behaviour appears highly different from that of the rest of Book X. © The Author 2016.

abstract={Deliberate differences in how authors represent characters has been a core area of literary investigation since the dawn of literary theory. Here, we focus on epistolary literature, where authors consciously attempt to create different character styles through series of documents like letters. Previous studies suggest that the linguistic gestalt of an author's style-the author's 'writeprint'-can be extracted from the various characters of an epistolary novel, but it is unclear whether individual characters themselves also have distinct writeprints. We examine Samuel Richardson's Clarissa, lauded as a watershed example of the epistolary novel, using a recently developed and highly successful authorship attribution technique to determine (1) whether Richardson can construct distinct character writeprints, and (2) if so, which linguistic features he manipulated to do so. We find that while there are not as many distinct character writeprints as characters, Richardson does appear to have signature features he alters to create distinct character styles-and few of these features are the function word or abstract syntactic features typically comprising author writeprints. We discuss implications for other questions about character identity in Clarissa and character writeprint analysis more generally. © The Author 2016.

abstract={Author name disambiguation in bibliographic databases has been, and still is, a challenging research task due to the high uncertainty there is when matching a publication author with a concrete researcher. Common approaches normally either resort to clustering to group author's publications, or use a binary classifier to decide whether a given publication is written by a specific author. Both approaches benefit from authors publishing similar works (e.g. subject areas and venues), from the previous publication history of an author (the higher, the better), and validated publicationauthor associations for model creation. However, whenever such an algorithm is confronted with different works from an author, or an author without publication history, often it makes wrong identifications. In this paper, we describe a feature extraction method that aims to avoid the previous problems. Instead of generally characterizing an author, it selectively uses features that associate the author to a certain publication. We build a Random Forest model to assess the quality of our set of features. Its goal is to predict whether a given author is the true author of a certain publication. We use a bibliographic database named Authenticus with more than 250, 000 validated author-publication associations to test model quality. Our model achieved a top result of 95.37% accuracy in predicting matches and 91.92% in a real test scenario. Furthermore, in the last case the model was able to correctly predict 61.86% of the cases where authors had no previous publication history. Copyright 2017 ACM.},

abstract={In this essay, Nicholas Seager argues for re-attributing two pamphlets to Daniel Defoe: A Secret History of One Year (1714) and Memoirs of the Conduct of Her Late Majesty and Her Last Ministry (1715). These works, published shortly after the Hanoverian succession, were excluded from Defoe's canon by Furbank and Owens on the grounds that the writing was poor in quality. A closer review of the external and internal evidence, however, points to Defoe as the author of these occasional political tracts, which reveal his attempts to attenuate what he perceived as the harmful effects of government by a single-party ministry. ©2017 by Henry E.

abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of author identification under double-blind review setting, which is to identify potential authors given information of an anonymized paper. Different from existing approaches that rely heavily on feature engineering, we propose to use network embedding approach to address the problem, which can automatically represent nodes into lower dimensional feature vectors. However, there are two major limitations in recent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose embedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of these approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the heterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two folds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author identification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to the heterogeneity of the network. To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and pathaugmented heterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded as vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly trained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend the existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in heterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The guidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both explicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection. Our experiments demonstrate that by using pathaugmented network embedding with task guidance, our model can obtain significantly better accuracy at identifying the true authors comparing to existing methods. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Compromising legitimate accounts has been the most used strategy to spread malicious content on OSN (Online Social Network). To address this problem, we propose a pure text mining approach to check if an account has been compromised based on its posts content. In the first step, the proposed approach extracts the writing style from the user account. The second step comprehends the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) to evaluate the post content and identify the user. Finally, Baseline Updating (third step) consists of a continuous updating of the user baseline to support the current trends and seasonality issues of user’s posts. Experiments were carried out using a dataset from Twitter composed by tweets of 1000 users. All the three steps were individually evaluated, and the results show that the developed method is stable and can detect the compromised accounts. An important observation is the Baseline Updating contribution, which leads to an enhancement of accuracy superior of 60 %. Regarding average accuracy, the developed method achieved results over 93 %. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Distributed word representation in a vector space (word embeddings) is a novel technique that allows to represent words in terms of the elements in the neighborhood. Distributed representations can be extended to larger language structures like phrases, sentences, paragraphs and documents. The capability to encode semantic information of texts and the ability to handle high- dimensional datasets are the reasons why this representation is widely used in various natural language processing tasks such as text summarization, sentiment analysis and syntactic parsing. In this paper, we propose to use the distributed representation at the document level to solve the task of the authorship attribution. The proposed method learns distributed vector representations at the document level and then uses the SVM classifier to perform the automatic authorship attribution. We also propose to use the word n-grams (instead of the words) as the input data type for learning the distributed representation model. We conducted experiments over six datasets used in the state-of-the-art works, and for the majority of the datasets, we obtained comparable or better results. Our best results were obtained using the combination of words and n-grams of words as the input data types. Training data are relatively scarce, which did not affect the distributed representation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Stylometry is the statistical analyses of variations in the author's literary style. The technique has been used in many linguistic analysis applications, such as, author profiling, authorship identification, and authorship verification. Over the past two decades, authorship identification has been extensively studied by researchers in the area of natural language processing. However, these studies are generally limited to (i) a small number of candidate authors, and (ii) documents with similar lengths. In this paper, we propose a novel solution by modeling authorship attribution as a set similarity problem to overcome the two stated limitations. We conducted extensive experimental studies on a real dataset collected from an online book archive, Project Gutenberg.

abstract={Authorship identification is the task of identifying the author of a given text from a set of suspects. The main concern of this task is to define an appropriate characterization of texts that captures the writing style of authors. Although deep learning was recently used in different natural language processing tasks, it has not been used in author identification (to the best of our knowledge). In this paper, deep learning is used for feature extraction of documents represented using variable size character n-grams. We apply A Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoder (SDAE) for extracting document features with different settings, and then a support vector machine classifier is used for classification. The results show that the proposed system outperforms its counterparts. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Authorship attribution is associated with important applications in forensics and humanities research. A crucial point in this field is to quantify the personal style of writing, ideally in a way that is not affected by changes in topic or genre. In this paper, we present a novel method that enhances authorship attribution effectiveness by introducing a text distortion step before extracting stylometric measures. The proposed method attempts to mask topicspecific information that is not related to the personal style of authors. Based on experiments on two main tasks in authorship attribution, closed-set attribution and authorship verification, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can enhance existing methods especially under cross-topic conditions, where the training and test corpora do not match in topic. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={This paper presents work on using continuous representations for authorship attribution. In contrast to previous work, which uses discrete feature representations, our model learns continuous representations for n-gram features via a neural network jointly with the classification layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on two datasets, while producing comparable results on the remaining two. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={Authorship attribution attempts to reveal the authors of documents. In recent years, research in this field has grown rapidly. However, the performance of state-of-the-art methods is heavily affected when text of known authorship and texts under investigation differ in topic and/or genre. So far, it is not clear how to quantify the personal style of authors in a way that is not affected by topic shifts or genre variations. In this paper, a set of text distortion methods are used attempting to mask topic-related information. These methods transform the input texts into a more topic-neutral form while maintaining the structure of documents associated with the personal style of the author. Using a controlled corpus that includes a fine-grained range of topics and genres it is demonstrated how the proposed approach can be combined with existing authorship attribution methods to enhance their performance in very challenging tasks, especially in cross-topic attribution. We also examine cross-genre attribution and the most challenging, yet realistic, cross-topic-and-genre attribution scenarios and show how the proposed techniques should be tuned to enhance performance in these tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that there are important differences in attribution effectiveness when either conversational genres, nonconversational genres, or a mix of them are considered. © 2017 ASIS&T.},

abstract={An experiment in forensic text comparison (FTC) within the likelihood ratio (LR) framework is described, in which authorship attribution was modelled with word-and character-based stylometric features. Chatlog messages of 115 authors were selected from a chatlog archive containing real pieces of chatlog evidence used to prosecute paedophiles. Four different text lengths (500, 1000, 1500 or 2500 words) were used for modelling in order to investigate how system performance is influenced by sample size. Strength of authorship attribution evidence (or LR) is estimated with the Multivariate Kernel Density formula. Performance was primarily assessed with the log-likelihood ratio cost (Cllr), but assessments of other metrics, e.g. credible interval and equal error rate, are also given. Taking into account the small number of features used for modelling authorship attribution, results are promising. Even with a small sample size of 500 words, the system achieved a discrimination accuracy of c. 76% (Cllr = 0.68258). With a sample size of 2500 words, a discrimination accuracy of c. 94% (Cllr = 0.21707) was obtained. Larger sample size is beneficial to FTC, resulting in an improvement in discriminability, an increase in the magnitude of the consistent-with-fact LRs and a decrease in the magnitude of the contrary-to-fact LRs. It was found that ‘Average character number per word token’, ‘Punctuation character ratio’, and vocabulary richness features are robust features, which work well regardless of sample sizes. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the LR framework for analysing authorship attribution evidence. © 2017, equinox publishing.},

abstract={This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised and effective authorship verification model called Spatium-L1. As features, we suggest using the 200 most frequent terms of the disputed text (isolated words and punctuation symbols). Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors, we can determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author. Moreover, based on a simple rule we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer or when the attribution scheme is unable to make a decision with a high degree of certainty. Evaluations based on 6 test collections (PAN CLEF 2014 evaluation campaign) indicate that Spatium-L1 usually appears in the top 3 best verification systems, and on an aggregate measure, presents the best performance. The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different Indo-European languages (such as English, Dutch, Spanish, and Greek) or genres (essay, novel, review, and newspaper article). © 2016 ASIS&T},

abstract={Authorship attribution aims at identifying the author of an unseen text document based on text samples originating from different authors. In this paper we focus on authorship attribution of Polish texts using stylometric features based on part of speech (POS) tags. Polish language is characterized by high inflection level and in consequence over 1000 POS tags can be distinguished. This allows building a sufficiently large feature space by extracting POS information from documents and performing their classification with use of machine learning methods. We report results of experiments conducted with Weka workbench using combinations of the following features: POS tags, an approximation of their bigrams and simple document statistics. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The majority of approaches to author profiling and author identification focus mainly on lexical features, i.e., on the content of a text. We argue that syntactic dependency and discourse features play a significantly more prominent role than they were given in the past. We show that they achieve state-of-the-art performance in author and gender identification on a literary corpus while keeping the feature set small: the used feature set is composed of only 188 features and still outperforms the winner of the PAN 2014 shared task on author verification in the literary genre. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={Our work is motivated by the idea to extend the retrieval of related scientific literature to cases, where the relatedness also incorporates the writing style of individual scientific authors. Therefore we conducted a pilot study to answer the question whether humans can identity authorship once the topological clues have been removed. As first result, we found out that this task is challenging, even for humans. We also found some agreement between the annotators. To gain a better understanding how humans tackle such a problem, we conducted an exploratory data analysis. Here, we compared the decisions against a number of topological and stylometric features. The outcome of our work should help to improve automatic authorship identification algorithms and to shape potential follow-up studies. © 2017, CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this work we propose to solve the author verification problem using a semantic space model through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We experiment with the corpus used in the author identification tasks at PAN 2014 and PAN 2015. These datasets consist of subsets in the following languages: English, Spanish, Dutch and Greek. Each problem contained in these corpora is formed by one to five known documents which were written by one author and one unknown document. The task is to predict whether the unknown document was written by the author who wrote the known documents. We processed the documents in the dataset and captured the fingerprint of authors by generating a probabilistic distribution of words in the documents. In PAN 2015 classification, we achieved 81.6%, 75.4%, 74.1%, 67.1%accuracy for each English, Spanish, Dutch and Greek subset respectively. In particular for the English subset, we outreached the best result reported in both competitions.},

abstract={The ancient notion of authorship and forgery can be analyzed in various ancient texts, including embedded texts (e.g., reported speeches) and independent texts, some written under the author's control (e.g., speeches, letters, and history books), as well as others written independently of the author's control (e.g., translations and unauthorized lecture publications). In all cases an authorial attribution was regarded as correct and nondeceptive if either content and wording or just the content of a particular text could be traced back to the author whose name it carried. This prevailing principle of ancient authorship attribution, while often taken for granted and applied without further explanation, was also stated explicitly in several places. These ancient statements are in conflict with the most innovative contribution of Bart Ehrman's otherwise very useful recent book Forgery and Counterforgery (2012). Ehrman has rightly joined the growing number of scholars who have raised substantive doubts regarding the once-popular thesis of innocent ancient pseudepigraphy. At the same time, his assertion that in antiquity a text's authenticity was assessed not on the basis of its content but always on the basis of its wording goes one step beyond what the numerous relevant ancient sources reveal.},

abstract={For the Authorship Attribution (AA) task, character n-grams are considered among the best predictive features. In the English language, it has also been shown that some types of character n-grams perform better than others. This paper tackles the AA task in Portuguese by examining the performance of different types of character n-grams, and various combinations of them. The paper also experiments with different feature representations and machine-learning algorithms. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that the performance of the character n-gram approach can be improved by fine-tuning the feature set and by appropriately selecting the length and type of character n-grams. This relatively simple and language-independent approach to the AA task outperforms both a bag-of-words baseline and other approaches, using the same corpus. © 2017, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

abstract={Stylometry is the study of writing style based on linguistic features and is typically applied to authorship attribution problems. In this work, we apply stylometry to a novel dataset of multi-authored documents collected from Wikia using both relaxed classification with a support vector machine (SVM) and multi-label classification techniques. We define five possible scenarios and show that one, the case where labeled and unlabeled collaborative documents by the same authors are available, yields high accuracy on our dataset while the other, more restrictive cases yield lower accuracies. Based on the results of these experiments and knowledge of the multi-label classifiers used, we propose a hypothesis to explain this overall poor performance. Additionally, we perform authorship attribution of pre-segmented text from the Wikia dataset, and show that while this performs better than multi-label learning it requires large amounts of data to be successful. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Authorship attribution aims at distinguishing texts written by different authors using text features representing their styles. In this paper we investigate stylometric features for the Polish language based on Part of Speech (POS) tagging (including POS bigrams) and function words. Due to high inflection level of Polish language the feature space tends to be very large. This in particular concerns POS n-grams. Focusing on POS bigrams, we propose their simplified representation allowing to keep the feature space compact. We report experiments, in which authorship attribution was conducted for varying in lengths documents, with use of classifiers from the Weka library. We evaluate classification results for combinations of the following features: POS tags, POS bigrams, function words and simple document statistics. Experiments indicate that the developed features provide good classification performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of author attribution through unsupervised clustering using lexical and syntactic features and novel deep learning based Stylometric model. For this purpose, we download all available 158918 publications accessible till 1 July 2015 from PLOS.org - an open access digital repository of full text publications. After pre-processing, out of these, we use 803 single authored publications written by 203 unique authors. For unsupervised modeling, stylometric markers such as lexical and syntactic features are used as a distance matrix by employing k-Means clustering algorithm. For supervised modeling, we present a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep learning model that predicts the testing accuracy of a given publication written by an author. Finally, our unsupervised model shows that 88.17% authors are classified into correct cluster (all papers written by the same author) with at most 0.2 coefficient of Entropy error. While our deep learning based model consistently shows above 95% accuracy across all the given testing samples of publications written by an author with an average loss of 0.21. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Authorship verification has gained a lot of attention during the last years mainly due to the focus of PAN@CLEF shared tasks. A verification method called Impostors, based on a set of external (impostor) documents and a random subspace ensemble, is one of the most successful approaches. Variations of this method gained top-performing positions in recent PAN evaluation campaigns. In this paper, we propose a modification of the Impostors method that focuses on both appropriate selection of impostor documents and enhanced comparison of impostor documents with the documents under investigation. Our approach achieves competitive performance on PAN corpora, outperforming previous versions of the Impostors method. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={In this paper, word embeddings are used for the task of supervised authorship attribution. While previous methods have for instance been looking at characters (n-grams), syntax and most importantly token frequencies, the method presented focusses on the implications of semantic relationships between words. With this instead of authors word choices, semantic networks of entities as perceived by authors may come closer into focus. We find that those can be used reliably for authorship attribution. The method is generally applicable as a tool to compare different texts and/or authors through word embeddings which have been trained separately. This is achieved by not comparing vectors directly, but by comparing sets of most similar words for words shared between texts and then aggregating and averaging similarities per text pair. On two literary corpora (German, English), we compute embeddings for each text separately. The similarities are then used to detect the author of an unknown text. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={We report on the second large-scale evaluation of style obfuscation approaches in a shared task on author obfuscation, organized at the PAN 2017 lab on digital text forensics. Author obfuscation means to automatically paraphrase a given text such that state-of-the-art authorship verification approaches misjudge a given pair of documents as having been written by "different authors" if in fact they would have decided otherwise without obfuscation. This year, two new obfuscators are compared to the participants from last year's task against a total of 44 authorship verification approaches. The best-performing obfuscator successfully impacts the decision-making process of the authorship verifiers significantly. However, as in the last year, the paraphrased texts are often not really human-readable anymore and have some changed context, indicating that there is still way to go to "perfect" automatic obfuscation that (1) tricks verification approaches, (2) keeps the meaning of the original, and (3) is, regarding its obfus-cation, unsuspicious to a human eye.},

abstract={Author and author gender identification are two major tasks in the context of profiling of authors of written material. Author identification (or, more precisely, "authorship attribution") copes with the assignment of the author, who is to be chosen from a given list of author names, to a piece of written material. Gender identification deals with the prediction of the gender of the author (male vs. female). Both tasks are very relevant to a number of applications, including, e.g., plagiarism and deception detection, document authenticity verification, and blackmailing. State of the art in both fields tends to rely mainly upon lexical and token (sequence) distribution features. But this means to neglect numerous linguistic studies that clearly indicate the high relevance of "deep linguistic", i.e., syntactic and discourse, features to the characterization of the style of an author or a group of authors. Our work on author and gender identification confirms this relevance. We show with two different genres, namely blog posts and literary writings, that the use of deep linguistic features is very effective. It leads to > 78% (in the case of blog posts) and > 91% (in the case of literary writings) of accuracy in author identification and > 89% (blog posts) and > 90% (literary writings) of accuracy in gender identification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper deals with the sub-task of PAN 2017 Author Identification, which is to detect style breaches for unknown number of authors within a single document in English. The presented model is an unsupervised approach that will detect style breaches and mark text boundaries on the basis of different stylistic features. This model will use some classical stylistic features like POS analysis and sentence lexical analysis. Also some new features naming common English word frequencies within sentence text, sentence expression and sentence attitude have been proposed. The new features may not be directly linked to author's style of writing but to the subject/topic of sentence under analysis. Moreover the model uses sentence window for style detection. The sentence window may be extended to neighboring sentences during its unsupervised analysis.},

abstract={Named entities (NE) are words that refer to names of people, locations, organization, etc. NE are present in every kind of documents: e-mails, letters, essays, novels, poems. Automatic detection of these words is very important task in natural language processing. Sometimes, NE are used in authorship attribution studies as a stylometric feature. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effect of the presence of NE in texts for the authorship attribution task: are we really detecting the style of an author or are we just discovering the appearance of the same NE. We used the corpus that consists of 91 novels of 7 authors of XVIII century. These authors spoke and wrote English, their native language. All novels belong to fiction genre. The used stylometric features were character n-grams, word n-gram and n-gram of POS tags of various sizes (2-grams, 3-grams, etc.). Five novels were selected for each author, these novels contain between 4 and 7% of the NE. All novels were divided into blocks, each block contains 10,000 terms. Two kinds of experiment were conducted: automatic classification of blocks containing NE and of the same blocks without NE. In some cases, we use only the most frequent n-grams (500, 2,000 and 4,000 n-grams). Three machine learning algorithms were used for classification task: NB, SVM (SMO) and J48. The results show that as a tendency the presence of the NE helps to classify (improvements from 5% to 20%), but there are specific authors when NE do not help and even make the classification worse (about 10% of experimental data). © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Several authorship analysis tasks require the decomposition of a multi-authored text into its authorial components. In this regard two basic prerequisites need to be addressed: (1) style breach detection, i.e., the segmenting of a text into stylistically homogeneous parts, and (2) author clustering, i.e., the grouping of paragraph-length texts by authorship. In the current edition of PAN we focus on these two unsupervised authorship analysis tasks and provide both benchmark data and an evaluation framework to compare different approaches. We received three submissions for the style breach detection task and six submissions for the author clustering task; we analyze the submissions with different baselines while highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract={The veil of anonymity provided by smartphones with pre-paid SIM cards, public Wi-Fi hotspots, and distributed networks like Tor has drastically complicated the task of identifying users of social media during forensic investigations. In some cases, the text of a single posted message will be the only clue to an author's identity. How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field. We argue that there is a significant need in forensics for new authorship attribution algorithms that can exploit context, can process multi-modal data, and are tolerant to incomplete knowledge of the space of all possible authors at training time. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a comparative study of language modeling to traditional instance-based methods for authorship attribution, using several different basic units as features, such as characters, words, and other simple lexical measurements, as well as we propose the use of part-of-speech (POS) tags as features for language modeling. In contrast to many other studies which focus on small sets of documents written by major writers regarding several topics, we consider a relatively large corpus with documents edited by non-professional writers regarding the same topic. We find that language models based on either characters or POS tags are the most effective, while the latter provide additional efficiency benefits and robustness against data sparsity. Moreover, we experiment with linearly combining several language models, as well as employing unions of several different feature types in instance-based methods. We find that both such combinations constitute viable strategies which generally improve effectiveness. By linearly combining three language models, based respectively on character, word, and POS trigrams, we achieve the best generalization accuracy of 96%. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Forensic authorship attribution is concerned with identifying the writers of anonymous criminal documents. Over the last twenty years, computer scientists have developed a wide range of statistical procedures using a number of different linguistic features to measure similarity between texts. However, much of this work is not of practical use to forensic linguists who need to explain in reports or in court why a particular method of identifying potential authors works. This paper sets out to address this problem using a corpus linguistic approach and the 176-author 2.5 million-word Enron Email Corpus. Drawing on literature positing the idiolectal nature of collocations, phrases and word sequences, this paper tests the accuracy of word n-grams in identifying the authors of anonymised email samples. Moving beyond the statistical analysis, the usage-based concept of entrenchment is offered as a means by which to account for the recurring and distinctive production of idiolectal word n-grams. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

abstract={Social networking sites are pervasively being used for seeking advice, asking questions, giving answers, and sharing experiences on various topics including health. When users share content about sensitive health topics, such as sexual dysfunction, infertility, or STDs, they may wish to do so anonymously to avoid stigmatization and the associated negative effects on mental health. However, a user masking their name with a pseudonym may still be inadvertently exposing their identity because of various quasi-identifiers present in their profile. One such quasi-identifier that has not been investigated in literature is the content itself, which could be used for authorship identification. Moreover, an anonymous user’s credibility cannot be established because their profile is no longer linked with their reputation. This study proposes the Iron Mask algorithm for providing enhanced anonymity while preserving trust. Iron Mask improves anonymity by using a probabilistic machine learning approach based on whiteprint identification and inclusion of content as a quasi-identifier. Iron Mask also introduces the concept of a trust-preserving pseudonym which masks user identity without loss of credibility. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using datasets from Quora, a question-answering social networking site, and demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm with satisfactory recall and survey feedback results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={We compare the performance of character n-gram features (n= 3 - 8) and lexical features (unigrams and bigrams of words), as well as their combinations, on the tasks of authorship attribution, author profiling, and discriminating between similar languages. We developed a single multi-labeled corpus for the three aforementioned tasks, composed of news articles in different varieties of Spanish. We used the same machine-learning algorithm, Liblinear SVM, in order to find out which features are more predictive and for which task. Our experiments show that higher-order character n-grams (n= 5 - 8) outperform lower-order character n-grams, and the combination of all word and character n-grams of different orders (n= 1 - 2 for words and n= 3 - 8 for characters) usually outperforms smaller subsets of such features. We also evaluate the performance of character n-grams, lexical features, and their combinations when reducing all named entities to a single symbol “NE” to avoid topic-dependent features. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Native Language Identification (NLI), as a variant of Language Identification task, focuses on determining an author's native language, based on a writing sample in their non-native language. In recent years, the challenging nature of NLI has drawn much attention from the research community. Its application and importance are relevant in many fields, such as personalization of a new language learning environment, personalized grammar correction, and authorship attribution in forensic linguistics. We participated in the INLI Shared Task 2017 held in conjunction with FIRE 2017 conference. To implement a machine learning method for Native Language Identification, we used Character and Word N-grams with SVM (Support Vector Machines) classifier trained with SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) method. We achieved F1 measure of 89.60% (using 10-fold cross validation), using provided social media dataset and 48.80% was reported in the final testing done by INLI workshop organisers.},

abstract={Introduction: Concerns about proper nutrition in childhood have been highlighted by the media. This is accompanied by an ongoing increase in the number of Internet pages, including those on social networks, channeled toward providing health information. Objective: To analyze the nutritional quality of snack recipes presented on web pages, aimed at preschoolers and described as healthy. Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out in 2015. A search was made for Brazilian web pages aimed at the lay public, and that contained snacks for children between 2 and 6 years of age. The first 20 URLs located by the search engine were selected and 10% of the recipes were set apart. The snacks were checked for compliance with steps 6, 7, and 8 of the Food Guide. Subsequently, nutritional labels were made for the preparations that met the three pre-established steps. Results: 85% of the pages were sites, 5% were blogs, and the rest were identified as sites/blogs. It was found that all were readable/comprehensible and 40% provided author identification. Of the 35 preparations initially observed, 31.4% met all three steps for healthy eating. In the qualitative analysis, seven were considered hypocaloric; only one of the snacks came close to the proposed carbohydrate content; two had excess protein. In general, the recipes had low quantities of: lipids, calcium, iron, sodium, and fiber. Conclusion: Less than half of the addresses consulted identified the author. In addition, the recipes were predominantly misleading, as most had inadequacies in macronutrient and micronutrient content.},

abstract={Identification of stormwater runoff, its pollution load, and their implications for land use is essential in implementing stormwater management strategies. Hydrologic modelling provides an opportunity to assess them at limited data resources. In this study, the stormwater management model SWMM5 is applied for model development for a large basin in Tallinn. A geographic information system tool is used for subcatchment delineation, identification of directly connected impervious areas (DCIAs), and preparation of catchment input parameters. The model is calibrated and verified using sampled storm events to estimate event mean concentrations and annual loads. The predictive capability of the model for quantity is good and for quality moderate. The findings from the model show the percentage of the impervious area in the large catchment to be low at 19.7%. Although DCIAs, in particular roads and roofs, have relatively smaller areas they significantly impact runoff production (up to 75%) and loads (up to 66% total phosphorus and 71% total suspended solids). The first flush at the beginning of runoff is less important in case of a low intensity of rainfall, but heavy rain and snowmelt generate substantial runoff and pollution loads. When grab sampling is applied, it should focus on the medium and large events within 6 hours of storm commencement in order to achieve better mass estimations. © 2017 Authors.},

abstract={Online social networks have contributed to the countless services that ease human interaction. But the veil of anonymity has become a resort to majority of cyber criminals who indulge in unethical cyber activities. The availability of Wi-Fi hotspots and smart phones has made tracking the individuals behind the activities, a daunting task. To curtail the worst impact of these activities, one can make use of identifying authors of text contents in online social media, the only readily available imprint of an individual. Here we propose a novel authorship analysis technique applied on twitter data using tone based, personality based and stylistic features. We propose an authorship attribution scheme by training author data using Convolutional Neural Network pretrained on personality data and combines the features obtained from this model with the features obtained from another CNN architecture for tone analysis proposed by us. These features are combined together with hand crafted features pertaining to the stylistic aspects of the author and an SVM is trained on these feature combination. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work employing tone based and personality based features for attributing authorship. The new approach paves way for a fool proof authorship analysis mechanism that can be employed to curb security issues like hacked account. This is because the features chosen for our attribution method are difficult to be imitated as well as consciously controlled. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Often lossless jet noise data obtained by various researchers in different facilities does not match after allowing for jet operating conditions, measurement distance, and nozzle dimensions using accepted jet noise scaling laws. There have been a number of explanations for these differences, but the most contentious of these is attributing rig-noise contamination to be the cause of the difference. This calls all the measurements that have been acquired in the facility into question. Knowing if jet noise is contaminated by rig-noise in a given facility is crucial to obtaining high-quality jet noise data and a simple method is needed to determine if rig-noise is indeed present in a given set of measurements. One such method is the so-called Doubling-Diameter Method first published by the second author. Verification of this method is the focus of the present study. This verification was conducted using cylindrical obstructions upstream of the nozzle-exit. Not only was it shown that this method can accurately detect rig-noise contamination, but in a case study the GTRI Anechoic Jet-Facility was shown to be free of rig-noise contamination. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={To study the evolution of the rhetoric and language style of the American presidents from 1789 to 2017, we have analyzed all the annual State of the Union (SOTU) and inaugural addresses. Those speeches present the intentions and indicate the legislative priorities of the Chief of the Executive. Based on this relatively fixed form, this analysis corroborates several studies and emphasizes new trends and methods. With the years, the mean sentence length becomes shorter to facilitate comprehension by a larger audience. To further improve this goal the vocabulary becomes less complex, and the percentage of big words decreases, indicating a preference for common words or expressions. The rhetoric evolves towards a more assertive and intimate tone with an increase in the occurrence of pronouns, particularly with the lemma we. Based on automatic classification techniques, we also observe that every president after 1961 generally has a clean and distinct style. When inspecting all presidents, some figures show a distinct break with their predecessors such as Lincoln, T. Roosevelt, Wilson, F.D. Roosevelt or Kennedy. A closer analysis of presidencies since 1961 reveals that, with time, governmental speeches include more words related to humans and emotional terms, as well as references to God and symbolic expressions (America, country, freedom). © 2017, RAM-Verlag.

abstract={Most journals and conferences adopt blind review process to ensure fairness through anonymization. Although the identity of an author is blinded in a manuscript, information about the author is known to the system when an account is created for submission. So, Information leak or the abuse from journal editor, who is able to access this information, could discredit the review process. Therefore, the triple-blind review process has been proposed to maximize anonymity through blinding the author, reviewer and also the editor. However, it has not been widely used compared to single- and double-blind review processes because there is difficulty in selecting the reviewers when the author is not known to the editor. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to select the adequate reviewers in the triple-blind review process without any disclosure of author information to even the editor.

abstract={Though like other domains such as email filtering, web page classification, sentiment analysis, and author identification, the researchers have employed the text categorization approach to automate organization and selection of design patterns. However, there is a need to bridge the gap between the semantic relationship between design patterns (i.e. Documents) and the features which are used for the organization of design patterns. In this study, we propose an approach by leveraging a powerful deep learning algorithm named Deep Belief Network (DBN) which learns on the semantic representation of documents formulated in the form of feature vectors. We performed a case study in the context of a text categorization based automated system used for the classification and selection of software design patterns. In the case study, we focused on two main research objectives: 1) to empirically investigate the effect of feature sets constructed through the global filter-based feature selection methods besides the proposed approach, and 2) to evaluate the significant improvement in the classification decision (i.e. Pattern organization) of classifiers using the proposed approach. The adjustment of DBN parameters such as a number of hidden layers, nodes and iteration can aid a developer to construct a more illustrative feature set. The experimental promising results suggest the significance of the proposed approach to construct a more representative feature set and improve the classifier's performance in terms of organization of design patterns. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the research contributions of authors and subauthors in order to outline how authorship, as opposed to acknowledgment, is awarded in the lab-based life sciences. Design/methodology/approach: The work tasks described in author contribution statements and acknowledgments sections of research articles published in Nature Chemical Biology were classified according to a three-layered taxonomy: core layer; middle layer; outer layer. Findings: Most authors are core or middle layer contributors, i.e. they perform at least one core or middle layer task. In contrast, most subauthors are outer layer contributors. While authors tend to be involved in several tasks, subauthors tend to make single contributions. The small but significant share of authors performing only outer layer tasks suggests a disconnect in author attribution between traditional author guidelines and scientific practice. A level of arbitrariness in whether a contributor is awarded authorship or subauthorship status is reported. However, this does not implicate first or last authorships. Research limitations/implications: Data from one journal only are used. Transferability is limited to research in high impact journals in the lab-based life sciences. Originality/value: The growth in scientific collaboration underlines the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of the distinction between authorship and subauthorship in terms of the types of research contributions that they de facto represent. By utilizing hitherto unexplored data sources this study addresses a gap in the literature, and gives an important insight into the reward system of science. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised author clustering model called Spatium. The proposed strategy can be adapted without any difficulty to different natural languages (such as Dutch, English, and Greek) and it can be applied to different text genres (newspaper articles, reviews, excerpts of novels, etc.). As features, we suggest using the m most frequent terms of each text (isolated words and punctuation symbols with m set to at most 200). Applying a distance measure, we define whether there is enough evidence that two texts were written by the same author. The evaluations are based on six test collections (PAN Author Clustering task at CLEF 2016). A more detailed analysis shows the strengths of our approach but also indicates the problems and provides reasons for some of the potential failures of the Spatium model. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Ontologies are complex systems of axioms in which unanticipated consequences of changes are both frequent, and difficult for ontology authors to apprehend. The effects of modelling actions range from unintended inferences to outright defects such as incoherency or even inconsistency. One of the central ontology authoring activities is verifying that a particular modelling step has had the intended consequences, often with the help of reasoners. For users of Prote´ge´, this involves, for example, exploring the inferred class hierarchy.This paper provides evidence that making entailment set changes explicit to authors significantly improves the understanding of authoring actions regarding both correctness and speed. This is tested by means of the Inference Inspector, a Prote´ge´ plugin we created that provides authors with specific details about the effects of an authoring action. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the Inference Inspector in two studies. In a first, exploratory study we determine the feasibility of the Inference Inspector for supporting verification and isolating authoring actions. In a second, controlled study we formally evaluate the Inference Inspector and determine that making changes to key entailment sets explicit significantly improves author verification compared to the standard static hierarchy/frame-based approach. We discuss the advantages of the Inference Inspector for different types of verification questions and find that our approach is best suited for verifying added restrictions where no new signature, such as class names, is introduced, with a 42% improvement in verification correctness. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We solved the problem of development of algorithmic software for processes of content monitoring for solving the problem of recognition of the style of an author of a Ukrainian text based on Web Mining and NLP technology. Decomposition of the method for recognition of the style of an author, based of analysis of the found stop words, was carried out. Specific features of the method include adaptation of morphological and syntactic analysis of lexical units to structural peculiarities of words/ texts in Ukrainian. It is syntactic words (stop words or anchor words) that are significant for an author's individual style, as they are not related to the theme and content of the publication. Recognition of the author's style is based on analysis of coefficients of lexical author's language: coherence of speech, lexical diversity, syntactic complexity indices of concentration and exclusivity for the author's fragment. They are used for subsequent comparison and determining of a degree of belonging of the analyzed text to a particular author. We studied internal "dynamics" of a text of randomly selected authors through analysis of coefficients of lexical author's language for the first k, n and m (without the title) words of the author's fragment and the analyzed one. The obtained results were compared. We obtained results of experimental testing of the proposed method for content-monitoring for determining and analysis of stop words in Ukrainian scientific texts of technical area based on Web Mining technology. It was found that for the selected experimental base that contains 100 works, the method for analysis of an article without compulsory initial information and list of references attains the best results by density criterion. It is achieved through learning of the system and by checking specified blocked words and specified thematic vocabulary. Testing of the proposed method for determining of keywords from other categories of texts - of scientific humanitarian area, belles-lettres, journalistic, etc. - requires subsequent experimental research. © V.

abstract={Authorship attribution is a classical classification problem. We use it here to illustrate the performance of a compression-based measure that relies on the notion of relative compression. Besides comparing with recent approaches that use multiple discriminant analysis and support vector machines, we compare it with the Normalized Conditional Compression Distance (a direct approximation of the Normalized Information Distance) and the popular Normalized Compression Distance. The Normalized Relative Compression (NRC) attained 100% correct classification in the data set used, showing consistency between the compression ratio and the classification performance, a characteristic not always present in other compression-based measures. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach to a closed-class authorship attribution (AA) problem. It is based on language modeling for classification and called modified language modeling. Modified language modeling aims to offer a solution for AA problem by Combinations of both bigram words weighting and Unigram words weighting. It makes the relation between unseen text and training documents clearer with giving extra reward of training documents; training document including bigram word as well as unigram words. Moreover, IDF value multiplied by related word probability has been used, instead of removing stop words which are provided by Stop words list. we evaluate Experimental results by four approaches; unigram, bigram, trigram and modified language modeling by using two Persian poem corpora as WMPR-AA2016-A Dataset and WMPR-AA2016-B Dataset. Results show that modified language modeling attributes authors better than other approaches. The result on WMPR-AA2016-B, which is bigger dataset, is much better than another dataset for all approaches. This may indicate that if adequate data is provided to train language modeling the modified language modeling can be a good solution to AA problem. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Studies are actively ongoing for better understanding and strengthening the capabilities of researchers. To do so requires an accurate diagnosis and analysis of such researchers. Therefore, data of each researcher must be collected and be identified in a big-data environment. Consequently, researcher-name identification has emerged as an important issue. This paper proposes a framework for collecting, refining, identifying, and publicly offering researcher data. For identifying authors’ name, the proposed framework extracts timeline based patterns that make help to identify the same name authors with their representative attributes such as emails and affiliations. The results of the proposed framework based on timeline patterns, show a 69.5 % average author-identification rate given a group of otherwise unidentified authors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this paper, we shed new light on the authenticity of the Corpus Caesarianum, a group of five commentaries describing the campaigns of Julius Caesar (100–44 BC), the founder of the Roman empire. While Caesar himself has authored at least part of these commentaries, the authorship of the rest of the texts remains a puzzle that has persisted for nineteen centuries. In particular, the role of Caesar's general Aulus Hirtius, who has claimed a role in shaping the corpus, has remained in contention. Determining the authorship of documents is an increasingly important authentication problem in information and computer science, with valuable applications, ranging from the domain of art history to counter-terrorism research. We describe two state-of-the-art authorship verification systems and benchmark them on 6 present-day evaluation corpora, as well as a Latin benchmark dataset. Regarding Caesar's writings, our analyses allow us to establish that Hirtius's claims to part of the corpus must be considered legitimate. We thus demonstrate how computational methods constitute a valuable methodological complement to traditional, expert-based approaches to document authentication. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Internet has provided people with new ways of expressing not only their individuality but also their collectivity i.e., their group affiliations. These group identities are the shared sense of belonging to a group. Online contact with others who share the same group identity can lead to cooperation and, even, coordination of social action initiatives both online and offline. Such social actions may be for the purposes of positive change, e.g., the Arab Spring in 2010, or disruptive, e.g., the England Riots in 2011. Stylometry and authorship attribution research has shown that it is possible to distinguish individuals based on their online language. In contrast, this work proposes and evaluates a model to analyse group identities online based on textual conversations amongst groups. We argue that textual features make it possible to automatically distinguish between different group identities and detect whether group identities are salient (i.e., most prominent) in the context of a particular conversation. We show that the salience of group identities can be detected with 95% accuracy and group identities can be distinguished from others with 84% accuracy. We also identify the most relevant features that may enable mal-actors to manipulate the actions of online groups. This has major implications for tools and techniques to drive positive social actions online or safeguard society from disruptive initiatives. At the same time, it poses privacy challenges given the potential ability to persuade or dissuade large groups online to move from rhetoric to action. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The well-known medieval Groenendaal monastery in Brabant has produced some of the finest examples of medieval Dutch literature, including Jan van Ruusbroec’s œuvre, who together with Anne Frank, remains the most frequently translated Dutch author of all time. Authorship attribution nevertheless remains a serious scholarly concern when it comes to the corpus of mystical texts from Groenendaal: because of the general proximity of the Groenendaal authors, their œuvres can be difficult to delineate. In this paper, I apply a quantitative, style-based methodology for authorship attribution to a sizable corpus of Groenendaal authors. These computational techniques are borrowed from the innovative field of stylometry in the Digital Humanities. I will discuss how the experimental results obtained are able to confirm and complement many of the authorship-related hypotheses developed in traditional Middle Dutch studies. Additionally, this work aims to demonstrate the exciting scholarly potential of ‘Distant Reading’ for the study of the rich textual heritage from the medieval Low Countries. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Binary code authorship identification is the task of determin-ing the authors of a piece of binary code from a set of known authors. Modern software often contains code from multi-ple authors. However, existing techniques assume that each program binary is written by a single author. We present a new finer-grained technique to the tougher problem of deter-mining the author of each basic block. Our evaluation shows that our new technique can discriminate the author of a basic block with 52% accuracy among 282 authors, as opposed to 0.4% accuracy by random guess, and it provides a practical solution for identifying multiple authors in software. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Authorship attribution, conceived as the identification of the origin of a text between different authors, has been a very active area of research in the scientific community mainly supported by advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and Computational Intelligence. This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric features and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous expression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich substrate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one-to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive communication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selection algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences. The performance and computational efficiency of different supervised learning models when incorporating the proposed feature selection method is shown to be promising with real SMS data in terms of identification accuracy, and paves the way towards future research lines focused on applying the concept of language typicality in the discourse analysis field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents a syntactic approach for the authorship attribution to literary texts. To this end, syntactic features were used in verification and identification approaches. We used also, a classification method based on dissimilarity that has been successfully applied in cases of authorship attribution. In addition, to evaluating two models, the writer-dependent model and writer-independent, we tested approaches based on polytomy and dichotomy. We also tested the impact of the redundancy, by varying the number of references for verification and identification, for short and long texts. In order to meet these goals, we conducted experiments with four different databases, which are journalistic and literary texts in Portuguese and English languages. Through a series of experiments, we showed that the proposed approach was able to surpass the results reported in the literature, in both languages. In our experiments the proposed approach achieved results higher than 90% in both languages for verification and above 75% for the identification. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Authorship profiling which is a process of the extraction of information about the unknown autohr of a text (demographics, psychological traits, et al.) based on the analysis of linguistic parameters, is a problem of great importance. Research in authorship profiling has always been constrainted by the limited availability of training data since collecting textual data with the appropriate metadata (information about authors of texts) requires a lot of effort. We are presenting RusPersonality-first Russian-language corpus of written texts labeled with data on their authors. A unique aspect of our corpus is the breadth of the metadata (gender, age, personality, neuropsychological testing data, education level, ect). Most texts were designed especially for this corpus, do not contain any borrowings and are not edited. The corpus is desinged to serve multiple purposes: authoriship profiling, authorship attribution, deception detection, genre detection etc. The corpus currently contains over 1850 documents from 1145 respondents and is currently expanding. The average length of the texts is 230 words. The corpus can freely be used for academic research purposes on demand.

abstract={Over the last few years, we have seen an increase in the number of Anonymous Social Networks (ASNs). What many internet users may not know is that their writing style can be tracked across the internet and even through an ASN. The good news is that by using a technique referred to as Adversarial Stylometry one can effectively imitate the writing style of another or even obfuscate their own writing style in an effort to conceal their true writing style - for the short term. The bad news is that recent research has shown that Adversarial Stylometry is not effective in concealing ones writing style over the long term. In this paper, we introduce a number of underlying concepts that will allow users to conceal their writing style over the long term. One such concept we refer to as Adversarial Authorship. In Adversarial Authorship, authors are provided an AuthorWeb which allows them to see graphically how their writing style compares with others in the AuthorWeb. The AuthorWeb presented in this paper uses Entropy-Based Evolutionary Clustering (EBEC) in an effort to cluster writing styles. Our results show that EBEC outperforms a number of other machine learning techniques for author recognition. Users of an AuthorWeb can then write to user-specified clusters in an effort to conceal their writing style. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Individuals, criminals or even terrorist organizations can use web-communication for criminal purposes; to avoid the prosecution they try to hide their identity. To increase level of safety in Web we have to improve the author (or web-user) identification and authentication procedures. In field of web author identification the situation of imbalanced data sets appears rather frequent, when number of one author's texts significantly exceeds the number of other's. This is common situation for the modern web: social networks, blogs, emails etc. Author identification task is some sort of classification task. To develop methods, technics and tools for web author identification we have to examine the performance of classification algorithms for imbalanced data sets. In this work several modern classification algorithms were tested on data sets with various levels of class imbalance and different number of available webpost The best accuracy in all experiments was achieved with Random Forest algorithm. © 2016 FRUCT.},

abstract={Authorship-identification is an actual research area with different applications. Particularly it is a question if only highly specialised and well equipped entities could identify an author or it could be made by broader community via exploiting text. In order to shed light on this question a very simple and computationally not demanding method for author identification was proposed based on lossless compression algorithms. In this paper another such method based on complexity is proposed and its verification on real data is presented. Results of experiments proved, that also such a simple method could be used successful identification of authors. © 2016 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

abstract={Author identification is a substantial factor in the global economic loss due to computer-related crimes. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), computer crimes or cyber-crimes cost the global economy an estimated 375 to 575 billion dollars each year [1]. Recently, various techniques have been used to improve the accuracy of author identification. In this paper, we propose combining unigram features and a variety of stylometric features that include n-grams and part-of-speech. Using a Reuters Corpus dataset of 2,500 unique articles (50 authors with 50 news articles each), we were able to effectively capture a non-topic sensitive sample. Results with the Weka machine learning software produced classification accuracies ranging from 76.08 to 84.88 percent using classification techniques such as Random Forest and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). Weka also ranked and weighted the most influential feature attributes. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In authorship attribution, one assigns texts from an unknown author to either one of two or more candidate authors by comparing the disputed texts with texts known to have been written by the candidate authors. In authorship verification, one decides whether a text or a set of texts could have been written by a given author. These two problems are usually treated separately. By assuming an open-set classification framework for the attribution problem, contemplating the possibility that none of the candidate authors is the unknown author, the verification problem becomes a special case of attribution problem. Here both problems are posed as a formal Bayesian multinomial model selection problem and are given a closed-form solution, tailored for categorical data, naturally incorporating text length and dependence in the analysis, and coping well with settings with a small number of training texts. The approach to authorship verification is illustrated by exploring whether a court ruling sentence could have been written by the judge that signs it, and the approach to authorship attribution is illustrated by revisiting the authorship attribution of the Federalist papers and through a small simulation study. © 2016 American Statistical Association.},

abstract={We analyze the linguistic evolution of selected scientific disciplines over a 30-year time span (1970s to 2000s). Our focus is on four highly specialized disciplines at the boundaries of computer science that emerged during that time: computational linguistics, bioinformatics, digital construction, and microelectronics. Our analysis is driven by the question whether these disciplines develop a distinctive language use—both individually and collectively—over the given time period. The data set is the English Scientific Text Corpus (scitex), which includes texts from the 1970s/1980s and early 2000s. Our theoretical basis is register theory. In terms of methods, we combine corpus-based methods of feature extraction (various aggregated features [part-of-speech based], n-grams, lexico-grammatical patterns) and automatic text classification. The results of our research are directly relevant to the study of linguistic variation and languages for specific purposes (LSP) and have implications for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, for example, authorship attribution, text mining, or training NLP tools. © 2015 ASIS&T},

abstract={The article introduces Quantum Clustering, a novel pattern recognition algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and extend it to text analysis. This novel method improves upon nonparametric density estimation (i.e. Parzen-window), and differentiates itself from it in a significant way, Quantum Clustering constructs the potential function to determine the cluster center instead of the Gaussian kernel function. Specifically, detailed comparative analysis shows that the potential function could clearly reveal the underlying structure of the data that the Gaussian kernel could not handle. Moreover, the problem of parameter estimation is solved successfully by the numerical optimization approach (i.e. Pattern Search). Afterwards, the results of detailed comparative experiments on three benchmark datasets confirms the advantage of Quantum Clustering over the Parzen-window, and the additional trial on authorship identification illustrates the wide application scope of this novel method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Most of the researchers collaborating with different institutions and involved in a number of international projects would be happy to have only one place where information about their academic activity could be stored, and everyone around the world could check it in a transparent way. In mid-2013 to early 2014, an online survey of researchers was conducted, and 8,554 fully completed questionnaires were analysed. The respondents represent all age and experience groups, fields of science, and continents in different proportions. The aim of this article is to discuss the topics touched upon in the survey: methods and software used by researchers to manage the list of their activities; outputs recorded by researchers, institutions, and the outputs which should not be part of an academic record according to the respondents; whom researchers entrust with the management of their public profile and the most important attributes that could make an author identification and academic record storage system attractive for researchers. © 2016 ALPSP.},

abstract={In authorship attribution, various distance-based metrics have been proposed to determine the most probable author of a disputed text. In this paradigm, a distance is computed between each author profile and the query text. These values are then employed only to rank the possible authors. In this article, we analyze their distribution and show that we can model it as a mixture of 2 Beta distributions. Based on this finding, we demonstrate how we can derive a more accurate probability that the closest author is, in fact, the real author. To evaluate this approach, we have chosen 4 authorship attribution methods (Burrows' Delta, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Labbé's intertextual distance, and the naïve Bayes). As the first test collection, we have downloaded 224 State of the Union addresses (from 1790 to 2014) delivered by 41 U.S. presidents. The second test collection is formed by the Federalist Papers. The evaluations indicate that the accuracy rate of some authorship decisions can be improved. The suggested method can signal that the proposed assignment should be interpreted as possible, without strong certainty. Being able to quantify the certainty associated with an authorship decision can be a useful component when important decisions must be taken. © 2015 ASIS&T.},

abstract={This article explores textual curation as a conceptualization of authorship and composition within large information structures that is heavily based on the canon of arrangement. This work is often undertaken through distributed collaboration, thus complicating traditional conceptions of authorial attribution and agency. Central curatorial processes include critical recomposition of prior texts along with the development of small and often invisible textual elements such as architecture, metadata, and strategic links. I offer a grounded definition of textual curation that draws from traditional curatorial fields such as Museum Studies and Library Science as well as Writing Studies' own subfield of Technical Communication, which focuses heavily on recomposed, collaboratively produced texts. Selected Wikipedia articles serve as case studies for examining live curatorial work in open, collaborative environments. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Can we tell the author of a message, without reading the message? This work tackles authorship analysis through features that ignore the explicit content of a contribution - informally, those that can be computed even if every character in the body of a message (but not metadata such as timing or \likes") is replaced by an X. Focusing on forum posts, we distil a case-study set of these content-agnostic features, and prove its viability for authorship verification and attribution, using data from four online forums (of different size, language, and topic). A simple classification testbed, relying exclusively on content-agnostic features, confirms the author of a message with 76% accuracy, and discriminates between two candidate authors with 94% accuracy. Being able to re-identify a user without looking at the content of her contributions poses a serious threat to common data anonymization practices. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={One of the most important requirements of building applicable models and meaningful indicators for the use of scientometrics at the micro and meso level is the correct identification and disambiguation of authors and institutes. Platforms like ResearcherID or ORCID with author registration providing high reliability but lower coverage now provide appropriate data sets for the development and testing of stochastic models describing the publication activity and citation impact of individual authors. This paper proposes a triangular model incorporating papers, citations and authors analogously to the dichotomous model used at higher levels of aggregation like countries or fields. This model is applied to a set of authors in any field of science identified by their ResearcherID. However, the main advantage of classical citation indicators to study citation impact under conditional productivity turned out to be the main problem in this triangle: the possible heterogeneity of the collaborating authors results in low robustness. A mere technical solution to this problem would be fractional counting at three levels but the conceptual issue, the different roles of co-authors causing this heterogeneity will never be solved by any algorithm. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Four distance functions were evaluated in order to determine which one better represents two types of style markers (named as static and dynamic) commonly used for authorship attribution tasks. Intertextual distances were analysed from different authors and evaluated if the closest text to another was written by the same author. Classic multidimensional scaling was used to visualize intertextual distances because we consider that this is a method that allows the judges to better understand and visualize the results. The outcome of this paper is that selecting different distance functions considering the type of style marker improves the clustering of texts from the same author. We concluded that while for static features Canberra distance is recomendable, the dynamic features must depend on the style of each author. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Researcher services have proliferated in recent years and numerous free or fee-based sites now promise increased visibility and impact for authors or contributors of publications and other research products. Not all services have the same goals, however, and it can be difficult to know with which services researchers should engage. In this article we establish three categories (author/researcher identification, academic/professional networking, and reference/citation management) and examine nineteen services that fit into those categories. Column Editor's Note This JLA column posits that academic libraries and their services are dominated by information technologies, and that the success of librarians and professional staff is contingent on their ability to thrive in this technology-rich environment. The column will appear in odd-numbered issues of the journal, and will delve into all aspects of library-related information technologies and knowledge management used to connect users to information resources, including data preparation, discovery, delivery and preservation. Prospective authors are invited to submit articles for this column to the editor at kenning.arlitsch@montana.edu © 2015, © Justin Shanks and Kenning Arlitsch.},

abstract={Authorship verification is a branch of forensic authorship analysis addressing the following task: Given a number of sample documents of an author A and a document allegedly written by A, the task is to decide whether the author of the latter document is truly A or not. We present a scalable authorship verification method that copes with this problem across different languages, genres and topics. The central concept of our method is a model, which is trained with Dutch, English, Greek, Spanish and German text documents. The model sets for each language specific parameters and a threshold that accepts or rejects the alleged author as A. The proposed method offers a wide range of benefits, e.g., a universal (static) threshold for each language and scalability regarding almost any involved component (classification function, ensemble strategy, features, etc.). Furthermore, the method benefits from low runtime due to the fact that no natural language processing techniques nor other computationally-intensive methods are involved. In our experiments, we applied the method on 28 test corpora including 4525 verification cases across 16 genres and a huge number of mixed topics, where we achieved competitive results (75% median accuracy). With these results we were able to outperform two state-of-the-art baselines, given the same training and test corpora. © 2016 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Now a days, ATM is used for money transaction for the convenience of the user by providing round the clock 24∗7 services in financial transaction. Bank provides the Debit or Credit card to its user along with particular PIN number (which is only known by the Bank and User).Sometimes, user's card may be stolen by someone and thisperson can access all confidential information as Credit card number, Card holder name, Expiry date and CVV number through which he/she can complete fake transaction. In this paper, we introduced the biometric encryption of "EYE RETINA" to enhance the security over the wireless and unreliable network as internet. In this method user can authorizeasthird person his/her behalf to make the transaction using Debit or Credit card.In proposed method, third person can also perform financial transaction by providing his/her eye retina for the authorization & identification purpose. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Authorship analysis is a text analysis technique that is visualized mainly in three different techniques namely Authorship Profiling, Authorship Identification and Plagiarism Detection. In this paper a brief survey on the recent developments in the area of author profiling approaches were presented. Authorship Profiling is to ascertain various authors characteristics like age, gender, native country, native language, degree of education and personality traits by analyzing their writing styles. In recent times, Author Profiling is popular in the fields of forensic analysis, security and marketing. Based on the popularity of the Authorship Profiling problem, multiple solutions were proposed by various researchers across the globe. Several researchers used different types of features to identify the writing style characteristics of authors. The main focus of this survey is to predict the demographic features of authors such as gender, age and personality traits based on the text corpus written by various authors. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={The contemporary global crisis can be explored in different perspectives. This text focuses on constitutionalism. It asks whether constitutionalism still matters. Responding to this question requires revisiting the basic analytical and normative concepts that shape individual autonomy, polity, law and democracy in the context of globalization. Part I of the article introduces the question of the crisis of constitutionalism. It briefly explores the dispute between proponents of state and post-state constitutionalism, and proceeds with an analysis of societal constitutionalism. The critical reading of this theory prepares the ground for a positive normative argument. Part II of the article argues for the return to the moral core of constitutionalism. It defends the claim that justice at the global stage requires establishing a minimum common denominator that would be composed of universalizable substantive principles. The institutional question follows. Its focus should be on the authoritative identification, protection and advancement of the core values of constitutionalism in the social and legal-political realms of the world society. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Now a days, writer identification is at high demand to identify the original writer of the script at high accuracy. The one of the main challenge in writer identification is how to extract the discriminative features of different authors’ scripts to classify precisely. In this paper, the adaptive division method on the offline Latin script has been implemented using several variant window sizes. Fragments of binarized text a set of features are extracted and classified into clusters in the form of groups or classes. Finally, the proposed approach in this paper has been tested on various parameters in terms of text division and window sizes. It is observed that selection of the right window size yields a well positioned window division. The proposed approach is tested on IAM standard dataset (IAM, Institut für Informatik und angewandte Mathematik, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) that is a constraint free script database. Finally, achieved results are compared with several techniques reported in the literature. © 2016, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Assessing whether two documents were written by the same author is a crucial task, especially in the Internet age, with possible applications to philology and forensics. The problem has been tackled in the literature by exploiting frequency-based approaches, numeric techniques or writing style analysis. Focusing on this last perspective, this paper proposes a novel technique that takes into account the structure of sentences, assuming that it is strictly related to the author’s writing style. Specifically, a (collection of) text(s) in natural language written by a given author is translated into a set of First-Order Logic descriptions, and a model of the author’s writing habits is obtained as the result of clustering these descriptions. Then, if an overlapping exists between the models of a known author and of an unknown one, the conclusion can be drawn that they are the same person. Among the advantages of this approach, it does not need a training phase, and performs well also on short texts and/or small collections. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Social networking sites are increasingly subject to malicious activities such as self-propagating worms, confidence scams and drive-by-download malwares. The high number of users associated with the presence of sensitive data, such as personal or professional information, is certainly an unprecedented opportunity for attackers. These attackers are moving away from previous platforms of attack, such as emails, towards social networking websites. In this paper, we present a full stack methodology for the identification of campaigns of malicious profiles on social networking sites, composed of maliciousness classification, campaign discovery and attack profiling. The methodology named REPLOT, for REtrieving Profile Links On Twitter, contains three major phases. First, profiles are analysed to determine whether they are more likely to be malicious or benign. Second, connections between suspected malicious profiles are retrieved using a late data fusion approach consisting of temporal and authorship analysis based models to discover campaigns. Third, the analysis of the discovered campaigns is performed to investigate the attacks. In this paper, we apply this methodology to a real world dataset, with a view to understanding the links between malicious profiles, their attack methods and their connections. Our analysis identifies a cluster of linked profiles focusing on propagating malicious links, as well as profiling two other major clusters of attacking campaigns. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Sunflower Movement is one of the most influential social movements in Taiwan over the past few decades. In order to protest the review process at the legislature, the protesters entered and occupied the building of the Legislative Yuan (the parliament) of Taiwan on March 18, 2014, without any sign in advance. This action shook the government and caught a high level of attention in Taiwan. People discussed the action from different viewpoints and showed their supporting and opposition on the movement in daily life as well as on social media sites. However, the information is in chaos since a large number of articles had been published during the movement. In order to realize the social discussions in a comprehensive way, major issues such as extracting notable threads and finding important authors among social sites need to be addressed. In this paper, we provide methodologies to quantify and predict the polarity of each article, we also present a consensus-based approach to identify influential authors on the social forum. From our results, our proposal is effective and efficient for identifying information and authors that are worthy of attention through the social movement. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Anonymity networks like Tor harbor many underground markets and discussion forums dedicated to the trade of illegal goods and services. As they are gaining in popularity, the analysis of their content and users is becoming increasingly urgent for many different parties, ranging from law enforcement and security agencies to financial institutions. A major issue in cyber forensics is that anonymization techniques like Tor's onion routing have made it very difficult to trace the identities of suspects. In this paper we propose classification set-ups for two tasks related to user identification, namely alias classification and authorship attribution. We apply our techniques to data from a Tor discussion forum mainly dedicated to drug trafficking, and show that for both tasks we achieve high accuracy using a combination of character-level n-grams, stylometric features and timestamp features of the user posts. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Possession of multiple userids by a single user happens when more than two userids actually belong to the same user. In analysis of audience response of TV program, it is so important to detect these multi-id users because they often use the multiple ids to manipulate audience response or to take illegal profits. Detecting multiple userids of a single user has similiar nature with authorship attribution in terms of identifying authorships for given arbitrary texts. The conventional supervised techniques for authorship attribution, however, are difficult to be employed directly to the problem of multiple userids detection. This is because we do not know real authors and multiple userids may belong to the same author in the task of multiple userids detection. In addition, since we can not have all authors in advance, userids can not be treated as classes. This paper proposes a method of learning the element-wise differences between multiple userids. Each userid is represented as a feature vector from their postings on web social media. Then the similarity vector between two userid vectors can be obtained by performing their element-wise difference. With the similarity vectors, we train the similarity patterns for detecting if multiple userids belong to the same user or not. In order to solve the problem successfully, we present six features which are effective for Korean social media. We conducted comprehensive experiments on the Korean social media dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed similarity learning method with all presented features is successful for detecting multiple userids on Korean social media. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The inclusion of semantic features in the stylometric analysis of literary texts appears to be poorly investigated. In this work, we experiment with the application of Distributional Semantics to a corpus of Italian literature to test if words distribution can convey stylistic cues. To verify our hypothesis, we have set up an Authorship Attribution experiment. Indeed, the results we have obtained suggest that the style of an author can reveal itself through words distribution too.},

abstract={Authorship identification is a problem of data mining and classification. There are numerous methods and algorithms have been published to understand its nature. Although, researchers still investigate best and simple solutions due to its heterogeneous and multilingual characteristics. This study introduced new authorship identification process based on artificial neural network (ANN) model using embedded stylistics features. It is well known that stylistics features mostly depend on the topic or genre of the article. Our dataset contains 22.000 Turkish newspaper articles which belong to different genres. The experimental results indicate that %97 success rate has been achieved with Levenberg Marguardt based classifier. It can be concluded that the corpus presented in this work for the first time might contribute to not only authorship identification but also other identification purposes. © 2016 IEEE.},

Since no open source implementations have been released for the selected papers to date, our public release will have a significant impact on researchers entering the field. This way, we lay the groundwork for integrating author identification with information retrieval to eventually scale the former to the web. Furthermore, we assess the reproducibility of all reimplemented papers in detail, and conduct the first comparative evaluation of all approaches on three well-known corpora. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={In this paper, we deal with the author identification issues of the document whose origin is unknown. To overcome these problems, we propose a new hybrid approach combining the statistical and stylistic analysis. Our introduced method is based on determining the lexical and syntactic features of the written text in order to identify the author of the document. These features are explored to build a machine learning process. We obtained promising results by relying on PAN@CLEF2014 English literature corpus. The experimental results are comparable to those obtained by the best state of the art methods.},

abstract={Authorship attribution deals with the prediction of the author of a (usually written) discourse. This is of high relevance to a number of applications, including plagiarism detection, authenticity verification and deception detection. So far, most of the state-of-the-art approaches to author attribution rely mainly upon lexical and token (sequence) distribution features. But this means to neglect numerous linguistic studies that clearly indicate the high relevance of syntactic features to the characterization of a personal style of an author.We show in an experiment with 26 authors that indeed the use of syntactic features helps us to achieve a >77% an accuracy. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={We report on the first large-scale evaluation of author obfuscation approaches built to attack authorship verification approaches: The impact of 3 obfuscators on the performance of a total of 44 authorship verification approaches has been measured and analyzed. The best-performing obfuscator successfully impacts the decision-making process of the authorship verifiers on average in about 47% of the cases, causing them to misjudge a given pair of documents as having been written by "different authors" when in fact they would have decided otherwise if one of them had not been automatically obfuscated. The evaluated obfuscators have been submitted to a shared task on author obfuscation that we organized at the PAN 2016 lab on digital text forensics. We contribute further by surveying the literature on author obfuscation, by collecting and organizing evaluation methodology for this domain, and by introducing performance measures tailored to measuring the impact of author obfuscation on authorship verification.},

abstract={The paper presents research on class imbalance in the context of construction of training sets for authorship recognition. In experiments the sets are artificially imbalanced, then balanced by under-sampling and over-sampling. The prepared sets are used in learning of two predictors: connectionist and rule-based, and their performance observed. The tests show that for artificial neural networks in several cases the predictive accuracy is not degraded but in fact improved, while one rule classifier is highly sensitive to class balance as it never performs better than for the original balanced set and in many cases worse. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Online messaging provides a convenient and effective means of fast communication. Along with personal communication it is being used by organizations for official communication. Many organizations make use of online messaging for exchanging sensitive and secret information. Although online messaging is used for legitimate purpose, it can be misused by various means. An attacker may masquerade as legitimate user by hijacking the connection or by conducting man-in-the-middle attack or by obtaining physical access to a user's computer. The reason behind masquerade as someone else could be spying, snooping and other malicious intentions. Unsupervised Techniques for Forensic Analysis of online messages are relatively unexplored area in Authorship Analysis research. This paper explores the application of unsupervised techniques for authorship Verification problem.

abstract={Crosslingual document classification aims to classify documents written in different languages that share a common genre, topic or author. Knowledge-based methods and others based on machine translation deliver state-of-the-art classification accuracy, however because of their reliance on external resources, poorly resourced languages present a challenge for these type of methods. In this paper, we propose a novel set of language independent features that capture language use from a document at a deep level, using features that are intrinsic to the document. These features are based on vocabulary richness measurements and are text length independent and self-contained, meaning that no external resources such as lexicons or machine translation software are needed. Preliminary evaluation results show promising results for the task of crosslingual authorship attribution, outperforming similar methods.},

The model includes extensions to structural correspondence learning needed to make it appropriate for the task. For example, we propose a median-based classification instead of the standard binary classification used in previous work. Our results show that punctuation-based character n-grams form excellent pivot features. We also show how singular value decomposition plays a critical role in achieving domain adaptation, and that replacing (instead of concatenating) non-pivot features with correspondence features yields better performance. © 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

In many situations finding the author of a document is very important, such as the detection of plagiarism for protecting s and forensic support during criminal investigations. This paper, thus explores a novel stylistic feature with the aim of accurately characterizing an author's work. In particular, the use of part-of-speech skip-grams and an in-house top-k sequential pattern mining algorithm are considered for the task of authorship attribution. A study using a collection of of 30 texts, written by 10 authors, consisting of 2,615,856 words and 99,903 sentences, confirms that mining part-of-speech skip-grams in texts facilitates authorship inference. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={We discuss a real-world application of a recently proposed machine learning method for authorship verification. Authorship verification is considered an extremely difficult task in computational text classification, because it does not assume that the correct author of an anonymous text is included in the candidate authors available. To determine whether 2 documents have been written by the same author, the verification method discussed uses repeated feature subsampling and a pool of impostor authors. We use this technique to attribute a newly discovered Latin text from antiquity (the Compendiosa expositio) to Apuleius. This North African writer was one of the most important authors of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century and authored one of the world's first novels. This attribution has profound and wide-reaching cultural value, because it has been over a century since a new text by a major author from antiquity was discovered. This research therefore illustrates the rapidly growing potential of computational methods for studying the global textual heritage. © 2015 ASIS&T},

abstract={Authorship attribution refers to the task of automatically determining the author based on a given sample of text. It is a problem with a long history and has a wide range of application. Building author profiles using language models is one of the most successful methods to automate this task. New language modeling methods based on neural networks alleviate the curse of dimensionality and usually outperform conventional N-gram methods. However, there have not been much research applying them to authorship attribution. In this paper, we present a novel setup of a Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) and apply it to a database of text samples from different authors. We investigate how the NNLM performs on a task with moderate author set size and relatively limited training and test data, and how the topics of the text samples affect the accuracy. NNLM achieves nearly 2.5% reduction in perplexity, a measurement of fitness of a trained language model to the test data. Given 5 random test sentences, it also increases the author classification accuracy by 3.43% on average, compared with the N-gram methods using SRILM tools.

abstract={The Author Identification task for PAN 2016 consisted of three dif-ferent Sub-Tasks: Authorship clustering, authorship links and author diarization. We developed a machine learning approaches for two of three of these tasks. For the two authorship related tasks we created various sets of feature spaces. The challenge was to combine these feature spaces to enable the machine learn-ing algorithms to detect these difference authors across multiple feature spaces. In the case of authorship clustering we combine these feature spaces and use a two-step approach for clustering. Then we use results of the clustering, and em-ploy new feature space to determine links between documents in given prob-lems.},

abstract={Plagiarism is considered to be a highly unethical activity in the academic world. Text-alignment is currently the preferred technique for estimating the degree of similarity with existing written works. Due to its dependency on other documents it becomes increasingly tedious and time-consuming to scale up to the growing number of online and offline documents. Thus, this paper aims at studying the use of stylometric features present in a document in order to verify its authorship. Two machine learning algorithms, namely k-NN and SMO, were used to predict the authenticity of the writings. A computer program consisting of 446 features was implemented. Ten PhD theses, split into different segments of 1000, 5000 and 10000 words, were used, totaling 520 documents as our corpus. Our results show that authorship attribution using stylometry method has generated an accuracy of above 90%, except for 7-NN with 1000 words. We also showed how authorship attribution can be used to identify potential cases of plagiarism in formal writings. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing availability of electronic documents poses some problems, such as identification of an anonymous text and plagiarism. This study aims to determine the author of a given document among the set of text documents whose author is known. Despite the excess number of researches conducted in English language for author identification in the last century, Turkish and other languages are gaining interest only in the last decade. Therefore, this study deals with the Author Identification problem using two different Turkish datasets, collected from two different Turkish newspapers. The datasets comprises 850 columns written by 17 columnists as a total, 50 columns from each columnist. 4 different Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, the K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree) have been employed and 99.7% accuracy is achieved with K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

abstract={The presented paper addresses problem of evaluation of decision systems in authorship attribution domain. Two typical approaches are cross-validation and evaluation based on specially created test datasets. Sometimes preparation of test sets can be troublesome. Another problem appears when discretization of input sets is taken into account. It is not obvious how to discretize test datasets. Therefore model evaluation method not requiring test sets would be useful. Cross-validation is the well-known and broadly accepted method, so the question arose if it can deliver reliable information about quality of prepared decision system. The set of classifiers was selected and different discretization algorithms were applied to obtain method invariant outcomes. The comparative results of experiments performed using cross-validation and test sets approaches to system evaluation, and conclusions are presented. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Author identification is a hot topic, especially in the Internet age. Following our previous work in which we proposed a novel approach to this problem, based on relational representations that take into account the structure of sentences, here we present a tool that computes and visualizes a numerical and graphical characterization of the authors/texts based on several linguistic features. This tool, that extends a previous language analysis tool, is the ideal complement to the author identification technique, that is based on a clustering procedure whose outcomes (i.e., the authors’ models) are not human-readable. Both approaches are unsupervised, which allows them to tackle problems to which other state-of-the-art systems are not applicable. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Identification and clarification of relationships between product properties is fundamentally important in industrial product development. The process is however frequently perceived difficult. The presented research aims at clarifying if a visual tool can provide help in this work. The tool is a combination of previously known techniques and has so far been implemented at two product developing companies. Results and reactions from the tests are hitherto positive and the conclusion is therefore that this extended casual diagram can be a useful addition to the product developer's toolbox. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of the PAN/CLEF evaluation lab. During the last decade, PAN has been established as the main forum of digital text forensic research. PAN 2016 comprises three shared tasks: (i) author identification, addressing author clustering and diarization (or intrinsic plagiarism detection); (ii) author profiling, addressing age and gender prediction from a cross-genre perspective; and (iii) author obfuscation, addressing author masking and obfuscation evaluation. In total, 35 teams participated in all three shared tasks of PAN 2016 and, following the practice of previous editions, software submissions were required and evaluated within the TIRA experimentation framework. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The vast majority of previous studies in authorship attribution assume the existence of documents (or parts of documents) labeled by authorship to be used as training instances in either closed-set or open-set attribution. However, in several applications it is not easy or even possible to find such labeled data and it is necessary to build unsupervised attribution models that are able to estimate similarities/differences in personal style of authors. The shared tasks on author clustering and author diarization at PAN 2016 focus on such unsupervised authorship attribution problems. The former deals with single-Author documents and aims at grouping documents by authorship and establishing authorship links between documents. The latter considers multi-Author documents and attempts to segment a document into authorial components, a task strongly associated with intrinsic plagiarism detection. This paper presents an overview of the two tasks including evaluation datasets, measures, results, as well as a survey of a total of 10 submissions (8 for author clustering and 2 for author diarization).},

abstract={Astroturfing is appearing in numerous contexts in social media, with individuals posting product reviews or political commentary under a number of different names, and is of concern because of the intended deception. An astroturfer works with the aim of making it seem that a large number of people hold the same opinion, promoting a consensus based on the astroturfer's intentions. It is generally done for commercial or political advantage, often by paid writers or ideologically-motivated writers. This paper brings the notion of authorship attribution to bear on the astroturfing problem, collecting quantities of data from public social media sites and analysing the putative individual authors to see if they appear to be the same person. The analysis comprises a binary n-gram method which was previously shown to be effective at accurately identifying authors on a training set from the same authors, while this paper shows how authors on different social media turn out to be the same author. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Identifying the author of a book or document is an interesting research topic having numerous real-life applications. A number of algorithms have been proposed for the automatic authorship attribution of texts. However, it remains an important challenge to find distinct and quantifiable features for accurately identifying or narrowing the range of likely authors of a text. In this paper we propose a novel approach for authorship attribution, which relies on the discovery of variable-length sequential patterns of parts of speech to build signatures representing each author's writing style. An experimental evaluation using 10 authors and 30 books, consisting of 2,615,856 words, from Project Gutenberg was carried. Results show that the proposed approach can accurately classify texts most of the time using a very small number of variable-length patterns. The proposed approach is also shown to perform better using variable-length patterns than with fixed-length patterns (bigrams or trigrams).

abstract={As almost all the successful author identification approaches are based on the word frequencies, the most obvious way to obfuscate a text is to distort those frequencies. In this paper we chose a subset of the most frequent words for an author and replace each one with one of their synonyms. In order to select the best synonym, we considered two measures: similarity of the original word and the synonym, the difference between the scores (probabilities) that are assigned to the original and distorted sentences by a language model. By using similarity, we aim to select words that are similar to the original word semantically, and by using a language model we try to favor word usages that are common.},

Thus, we proposed a variation of this technique for tackling the Author Profiling task. Performed experiments showed that using about 8000 most frequent character n-grams for the construction of the different profiles, our proposed method obtains a better performance for both the same genre of documents as well as for the cross-genre scenario.},

Three different approaches of processing for training and test datasets are presented: “independent”—where discretization is performed separately for both sets assuming that the same algorithm parameters are used; “glued”—where both sets are concatenated, discretized, and resulting set is separated to obtain training and test sets, and finally “test on learn”—where test dataset is discretized using ranges obtained from learning data. All methods have been investigated and tested in authorship attribution domain using Naive Bayes classifier. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={In order to facilitate a practice of reuse of datasets in the humanities, an ecosystem has to exist in which scholars can publish their datasets, correctly attribute this data according to the roles played by each author, share these datasets, and allow for various scenarios of reuse. We have developed the web-based research environment nodegoat1 that allows for the creation of complex datasets. Current publication channels do not allow for complex authorship attribution. In this paper we explore reuse scenarios by means of an object-oriented referencing system in which datasets, data selections, entities and records are all referenceable objects with uniquely identifiable authors. Once a reference has been made to any of these objects, a citation is automatically determined based on the position of the referenced object in the network and all their corresponding authors. This object-oriented referencing system paves the way for various scenarios of reuse and processes of asynchronous collaboration. Copyright held by the author(s).},

abstract={One of the reasons for the wide popularity of rule classification systems is their ability to enhance understanding of mined data, and structures present in it. The discovered patterns are stated explicitly, which allows for more transparent descriptions of learned knowledge. To reach this goal of good descriptive and generalisation properties, induced rules need to be of a certain quality, which is typically measured by the predictive accuracy of the rule classifier. The paper presents research dedicated to measuring qualities of the inferred rules by taking into account a ranking of considered conditional attributes. Calculated quality measures along with supports of rules lead to construction of new classifiers, with improved parameters. The process is illustrated by a case of binary authorship attribution based on recognition of writing styles. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Authorship attribution (AA) aims to identify the authors of a set of documents. Traditional studies in this area often assume that there are a large set of labeled documents available for training. However, in the real life, it is often difficult or expensive to collect a large set of labeled data. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification. In this paper, we present a novel three-view Tri-Training method to iteratively identify authors of unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each document in three distinct views, and then perform Tri-Training to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents. Starting from 10 training documents per author, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Tri-Training method for AA. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised method CNG+SVM and other baselines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To bring bibliometrics and information retrieval closer together, we propose to add the concept of author attribution into the pre-processing of scientific publications. Presently, common bibliographic metrics often attribute the entire article to all the authors affecting author-specific retrieval processes. We envision a more finegrained analysis of scientific authorship by attributing particular segments to authors. To realize this vision, we propose a new feature representation of scientific publications that captures the distribution of stylometric features. In a classification setting, we then seek to predict the number of authors of a scientific article. We evaluate our approach on a data set of ∼ 6100 PubMed articles and achieve best results by applying random forests, i.e., 0.76 precision and 0.76 recall averaged over all classes.},

abstract={Data is increasing in recent years due to the development of mobile communication technology and the spread of smart devices. These large amounts of data are called "Big-Data." To process Big-Data, a variety of technologies have emerged. Of those, the most prominent technology is Hadoop. Hadoop introduced Kerberos and Token system for security. Nonetheless, it still has various problems including session key leakage issue, key sharing issue of NameNode and DataNode, replay attack of block accessed token, impersonation attack, etc. This study proposed HDFS using group key management system in order to resolve these vulnerabilities while keeping the optimal performance. The proposed system manages the secret key and group key of client and the group key of DataNode by bundling clients and DataNode as a respective logical group. Also, our study proposed client authentication using the proposed system and authority verification and BAT protocol when accessing files. © 2016, Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

Problems have tended to involve comparing one document to a small set of documents (n<=5) of known authorship. This paper discusses the adaptation of one of our approaches to a PAN 2016 problem of author clustering, which involves generating clusters within larger sets of documents (n<=100) for an unknown number of distinct authors, where each set is in English, Dutch or Greek. We describe our previous approaches as the background to the approach taken to this task and briefly overview the results that were achieved, which are not expected to be particularly remarkable due to substantial limitations on our time around the task.},

abstract={This paper discusses a novel time series methodology for writing process modeling, taking into account the dependency between sequentially written text parts. A series of consecutive sub-documents of a given document are represented via histograms of the appropriately chosen terms. To characterize the document overall style and its fluctuations, a new feature named the Mean Dependence is introduced. This similarity measure quantifies the association between a current sub-document and numerous earlier composed ones. So, such a collection of sub-documents is represented as a time series of the Mean Dependence development. The series change points naturally link to the style changes. Two possible approaches constructed within the general methodology are discussed. The first one intended to study media sources, is constructed to detect change points of media associated with social life transformations. Consequently, the homogeneous periods are detected using a new distance based on the Mean Dependence. The proposed methodology is applied to analysis of editorial texts published in the Egyptian "Al-Ahraam" and succeeds to indicate several important events connected to the "Arab Spring". The second approach, based on the strictly stationary model of time series, is applied to authorship verification. Numerical experiments demonstrate high ability of the proposed methods to recognize an authorship and to expose writing style evolution. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper describes the winning solution of team National Taiwan University for track 1 of KDD Cup 2013. The track 1 in KDD Cup 2013 considers the paper-author identification problem, which is to identify whether a paper is truly written by an author. First, we conduct feature engineering to transform the various types of provided text information into 97 features. Second, we train classification and ranking models using these features. Last, we combine our individual models to boost the performance by using results on the internal validation set and the official Valid set. Some effective post-processing techniques have also been proposed. Our solution achieves 0.98259 MAP score and ranks the first place on the private leaderboard of the Test set. © 2015 Chun-Liang Li et al.},

abstract={We propose a possible solution to one of the major weaknesses in the application of authorship attribution-the absence of clear-cut standards for accurate analytic practice. To address this, we propose a specific practice as a possible standard and present four recent cases applying this standard. The key elements of this protocol are the use of an ad hoc distractor set in conjunction with multiple analyses structured as a set of elimination tests. This protocol (or close variants of it) has been used in at least four separate cases across a wide variety of documents and consumers. It is mathematically supported while still being easy to understand. We are confident that the proposed protocol will provide a relatively straightforward and understandable way to reduce controversy regarding stylometric authorship attribution, and thereby increase its uptake and credibility. © The Author 2015.

abstract={This article motivates and details the first implementation of a freely available part of speech tag set and tagger for Coptic. Coptic is the last phase of the Egyptian language family and a descendant of the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Unlike classical Greek and Latin, few resources for digital and computational work have existed for ancient Egyptian language and literature until now. We evaluate our tag set in an inter-annotator agreement experiment and examine some of the difficulties in tagging Coptic data. Using an existing digital lexicon and a small training corpus taken from several genres of literary Sahidic Coptic in the first half of the first millennium, we evaluate the performance of a stochastic tagger applying a fine-grained and coarse-grained set of tags within and outside the domain of literary texts. Our results show that a relatively high accuracy of 94-95% correct automatic tag assignment can be reached for literary texts, with substantially worse performance on documentary papyrus data. We also present some preliminary applications of natural language processing to the study of genre, style, and authorship attribution in Coptic and discuss future directions in applying computational linguistics methods to the analysis of Coptic texts. © The Author 2015.

abstract={This essay addresses the vexed question of the genre of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter by considering the framing of the psalms in the early editions printed in England and on the continent. It is undeniable that all of the producers of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter were committed to the dissemination of Scripture in the vernacular and that many were concerned with approximating the hebraica veritas. But comparing the title pages, prefaces, and marginal notes included in the sixteenth-century versions of the psalter with those of contemporary prose translations reveals that the editors of the psalter distinguished the metrical psalms from prose translations by carefully marking them as the poetic products of particular authors. In calling on the names and titles of the versifiers as sources of the volume’s authority, the editors of the Sternhold and Hopkins psalter forged an understanding of poetic authorship that would prove influential not only for later psalm translators but for English poets more generally. Indeed, this essay makes the case that the practices of authorial attribution employed in the psalters may have directly influenced the presentation of more celebrated verse anthologies like Tottel’s Songes and Sonettes. © 2015, Iter.

The strength also of the several arguments brought by them, for the lawfulness of forms to be used universally by ministers, in their publick ministrations, is fairly tried (London, B1r; (1661), Collinges’s argument about Sternhold and Hopkins is a response to an argument made in a 1661 tract that the nonconformist preachers “praise God in prescribed forms made by Sternhold and Hopkins”: Ireneus Freeman, the reasonablenesse of divine service: or non-conformity to common-prayer, proved not conformable to common reason: in answer to the contrary pretensions of H.

Robin Leaver, following Nicholas Temperley, has added to the discussion of the popularizing intentions of Sternhold by arguing that the ballad metre he adopted was not widely used at the time and that it only became popular as a result of Sternhold and Hopkins.

Ramie Targoff mentions the implication of “artful labor” in the titles of sixteenth-century psalters and recognizes that this indicates an acknowledgement that something besides “strict translation” is at work, though, she insists, it is still not “poetic production of lyric”; see Targoff, 72–73. For discussion of the rage for metrical Scripture from 1549–1554, see Leaver, 137–39 and Quitslund, 59–109; Coverdale, G., 3r; Coverdale, A paraphrasis, A2r. Zim uses Coverdale’s distinction between paraphrase and the text itself as a structuring distinction for her account of early modern imitatio and the Psalms. Hamlin is right to point out that the various words for translation in the period are more slippery than Zim acknowledges, but her dichotomy is nevertheless helpful. Zim, 12.

John King makes the case that, in contrast to later Puritans, the non-conformist Crowley viewed poetry as a powerful tool of reform; see King’s “Robert Crowley: A Tudor Gospelling Poet,” YES 8 (1978): 220–37; see Josef Eskhult, “Latin Bible Translations in the Protestant Reformation: Historical Contexts, Philological Justification, and the Impact of Classical Rhetoric on the Conception of Translation Methods,” Shaping the Bible in the Reformation: Books, Scholars, and Their Readers in the Sixteenth Century, ed. Bruce Gordon and Matthew McLean (Leiden: Brill, 2012), 178–79. Quitslund also connects the Latin dedication to Owen Oglethorpe, president of Magdalen College, Oxford, to Crowley’s pretensions to scholarliness, noting that Oglethorpe’s conservative religious views make him an otherwise strange choice. Quitslund, 91; Crowley, **2r; Sternhold, T., Psalmes, C., chose[n] out of the psalter of Dauid, and drawe[n] into English metre by Thomas Sternhold grome of ye kynges Maiesties Roobes (London, ca. 1547–49). Because it is dedicated to “our soveraigne Lorde Kynge Edward the.vi,” the first version must have been printed after Edward’s coronation in February 1547. The first version seems to have been printed before Sternhold’s death in August 1549 since the title of the second version declares that it contains the psalms that the “late grome of [the] kinges Maiesties Robes didde in his life time draw into English Metre.” The printer of both versions, Edward Whitchurch, was one of Sternhold’s executors. See Sternhold’s will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/32/512 sig. 37; Donne used the verb to describe the violent restraint metrical form imposes on human passions: the speaker in “The Triple Fool” says, “I thought, if I could draw my paines,/Through Rimes vexation, I should them allay”; see Poems, by J.

abstract={The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author's characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as 'representative', but we likewise seek elements which the author uses 'distinctively' in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors' works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows' 'Delta' and Hoovers' 'CoV Tuning'; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the twoauthor comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering. © The Author 2015.

abstract={The problem of author identification can be defined in the following way: given a set of documents written by an author and a new document, we have to decide if this last one was written or not by the same author as the other documents. For solving this problem we have suggested and implemented various approaches: counting method, vote technique and supervised learning which explore several models of document representation. The experiences carried out using the collections of PAN-CLEF 2014 challenge have confirmed the interest of our approaches as well as their performance in terms of running time. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Verification of temporal logic properties plays a crucial role in proving the desired behaviors of hybrid systems. In this paper, we propose an interval method for verifying the properties described by a bounded linear temporal logic. We relax the problem to allow outputting an inconclusive result when verification process cannot succeed with a prescribed precision, and present an efficient and rigorous monitoring algorithm that demonstrates that the problem is decidable. This algorithm performs a forward simulation of a hybrid automaton, detects a set of time intervals in which the atomic propositions hold, and validates the property by propagating the time intervals. A continuous state at a certain time computed in each step is enclosed by an interval vector that is proven to contain a unique solution. In the experiments, we show that the proposed method provides a useful tool for formal analysis of nonlinear and complex hybrid systems. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={We offer an automated way of estimating the author of a song using only its lyrics content. To this end, we introduce a complete text classification framework which takes raw lyrics data as input and report estimated songwriter. The performance of the system is evaluated based on its classification and retrieval ability on a large dataset of Turkish songs, which was collected in this study. The results promote the use of such technique as a complementary tool in music information retrieval applications. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose, design, and construct a smart load management (SLM) system that can be effectively utilized to meet up emergency demand (light and fan) of consumers when power generation is not sufficient with respect to its demand. The connectivity among power distribution authority, SLM device, and user are established by authority identification number, device identification number, and user identification number using GSM-based mobile network. The SLM device can be configured and reconfigured load simply by SMS without changing hardware or software. Using the device, the power distribution authority will be able to provide power for emergency loads of all consumers and also to monitor maximum allowable permitted load. Instead of complete blackout, SLM device facilitates switching over from permitted load to emergency and vice versa depending on the availability of the power supply. The SLM system can be effectively applied in a country where demand of electricity is more than its generation. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This article explores the collaboration between the two Italian poets Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa that led to the librettos of three operas by Giacomo Puccini: La Bohème, Tosca, and Madama Butterfly. We used non-traditional authorship attribution methods (such as principal component analysis) and pattern recognition methods (such as partial least-squares discrimination analysis) to investigate whether traces of the two authors' personal writing styles could be highlighted in the final output of their collaboration. Working in a closed authorship attribution problem framework, we show that the influence of Luigi Illica on the versification of these librettos and their general poetic tone may be even greater than suggested by recent traditional scholarly studies. Vocabulary analysis carried in a natural language processing framework suggests that Illica contributed not only (and perhaps not mainly) to the drama but also significantly to the poetic tone of the librettos. Novel directions in Puccini scholarly research emerge from the results of our computational approach to the Illica-Giacosa collaboration. © The Author 2014.

abstract={Arguably, the most difficult task in text classification is to choose an appropriate set of features that allows machine learning algorithms to provide accurate classification. Most state-of-the-art techniques for this task involve careful feature engineering and a pre-processing stage, which may be too expensive in the emerging context of massive collections of electronic texts. In this paper, we propose efficient methods for text classification based on information-theoretic dissimilarity measures, which are used to define dissimilarity-based representations. These methods dispense with any feature design or engineering, by mapping texts into a feature space using universal dissimilarity measures; in this space, classical classifiers (e.g. nearest neighbor or support vector machines) can then be used. The reported experimental evaluation of the proposed methods, on sentiment polarity analysis and authorship attribution problems, reveals that it approximates, sometimes even outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques, despite being much simpler, in the sense that they do not require any text pre-processing or feature engineering. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Identifying authors of short texts on Internet or social media based communication systems is an important tool against fraud and cybercrimes. Besides the challenges raised by the limited length of these short messages, evolving language and writing styles of authors of these texts makes authorship attribution difficult. Most current short text authorship attribution approaches only address the challenge of limited text length. However, neglecting the second challenge may lead to poor performance of authorship attribution for authors who change their writing styles. In this paper, we analyse the temporal changes of word usage by authors of tweets and emails and based on this analysis we propose an approach to estimate the dynamicity of authors' word usage. The proposed approach is inspired by time-aware language models and can be employed in any time-unaware authorship attribution method. Our experiments on Tweets and the Enron email dataset show that the proposed time-aware authorship attribution approach significantly outperforms baselines that neglect the dynamicity of authors.},

The method in focus is writeprint matching, which employs frequent pattern mining to create the writeprint of each suspect and computes a similarity score between this writeprint and the pattern found in an anonymous message. It achieved an average accuracy of 82%, while other well-known methods, support vector machine (SVM) and C4.5 decision tree, achieved average accuracies of 89% and 81%, respectively. As for the identification of individual author, all three methods were as good as each other in most cases. The writeprint matching method had potential in reducing Type I error or the chance of dismissing real offenders. However, its performance was still limited when the suspects had too similar writing styles. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a clustering and authorship attribution study over the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2014 (224 speeches delivered by 41 presidents). To define the style of each presidency, we have applied a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the part-of-speech (POS) frequencies. From Roosevelt (1934), each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word-types, we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president. This second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7% under some constraints. When an incorrect assignment is detected, the proposed author often belongs to the same party and has lived during roughly the same time period as the presumed author. A deeper analysis of some incorrect assignments reveals interesting reasons justifying difficult attributions. © 2015 ASIS&T.},

abstract={The summer of 2013 should surely be marked on the calendar as a hallmark year in the long-running tradition of Shakespeare authorship studies. For in the month of August, Douglas Bruster, a Shakespearean scholar working at the University of Austin (Texas), gained the front headlines of various newspapers across the globe announcing that he had found persuasive evidence of Shakespeare’s ‘fingerprints’ on the 1602 Additions to Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. Bruster, however, acknowledges his allegiance to previous scholarly work (he specifically mentions the work of Brian Vickers) pointing ahead towards this same direction. Along this essay, it is my purpose to review various methods of authorship attribution studies and to purvey further evidences pointing to Shakespeare as the most likely candidate for such Additions. As I would like to argue, whereas none of the methods under scrutiny has proven to be infallible per se, if taken together they can contribute to dispel the enigma of the Shakespearean canon. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Author attribution through the recognition of visual characteristics is a commonly used approach by art experts. By studying a vast number of artworks, art experts acquire the ability to recognize the unique characteristics of artists. In this article, we present an approach that uses the same principles to discover the characteristic features that determine an artist?s touch. By training a convolutional neural network (PigeoNET) on a large collection of digitized artworks to perform the task of automatic artist attribution, the network is encouraged to discover artist-specific visual features. The trained network is shown to be capable of attributing previously unseen artworks to the actual artists with an accuracy of more than 70%. In addition, the trained network provides fine-grained information about the artist-specific characteristics of spatial regions within the artworks. We demonstrate this ability by means of a single artwork that combines characteristics of two closely collaborating artists. PigeoNET generates a visualization that indicates for each location on the artwork who is the most likely artist to have contributed to the visual characteristics at that location. We conclude that PigeoNET represents a fruitful approach for the future of computer-supported examination of artworks. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to find such a minimal size of text samples for authorship attribution that would provide stable results independent of random noise. A few controlled tests for different sample lengths, languages, and genres are discussed and compared. Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted 'bags of words' turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words ('passages') of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method (Burrows, J.F. (2002). 'Delta': a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 17(3): 267-87) applied to the most frequent words, some additional experiments have been conducted for support vector machines and k-NN applied to most frequent words, character 3-grams, character 4-grams, and parts-of-speech-tag 3-grams. Despite significant differences in overall attributive success rate between particular methods and/or style markers, the minimal amount of textual data needed for reliable authorship attribution turned out to be method-independent. © The Author 2013.

abstract={Different computational models have been proposed to automatically determine the most probable author of a disputed text (authorship attribution). These models can be viewed as special approaches in the text categorization domain. In this perspective, in a first step we need to determine the most effective features (words, punctuation symbols, part-of-speech, bigram of words, etc.) to discriminate between different authors. To achieve this, we can consider different independent feature-scoring selection functions (information gain, gain ratio, pointwise mutual information, odds ratio, chi-square, bi-normal separation, GSS, Darmstadt Indexing Approach (DIA), and correlation coefficient). Other term selection strategies have also been suggested in specific authorship attribution studies. To compare these two families of selection procedures, we have extracted articles from two newspapers and belonging to two categories (sports and politics). To enlarge the basis of our evaluations, we have chosen one newspaper written in the English language ('Glasgow Herald') and a second one in Italian ('La Stampa'). The resulting collections contain from 987 to 2,036 articles written by four to ten columnists. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the chisquare measure and the Delta rule as attribution schemes, this study found that some simple selection strategies (based on occurrence frequency or document frequency) may produce similar, and sometimes better, results compared with more complex ones. © The Author 2013.

abstract={An important area of social network research is identifying missing information which is not explicitly represented in the network or is not visible to all. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Approach of Classifier and Clustering, which we refer to as HACC, to solve the missing node identification problem in social networks. HACC utilizes a classifier as a preprocessing step in order to integrate all known information into one similarity measure and then uses a clustering algorithm to identify missing nodes. Specifically, we used the information on the network structure, attributes about known users (nodes) and pictorial information to evaluate HACC and found that it performs significantly better than other missing node algorithms. We also argue that HACC is a general approach and domain independent and can be easily applied to other domains. We support this claim by evaluating HACC on a second authorship identification domain as well. Copyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Accurately determining who wrote a manuscript has captivated scholars of literary history for centuries, as the true author can have important ramifications in religion, law, literary studies, philosophy, and education. A wide array of lexical, character, syntactic, semantic, and application-specific features have been proposed to represent a text so that authorship attribution can be established automatically. Although surface-level features have been tested extensively, few studies have systematically explored high-level features, in part due to limitations in the natural language processing techniques required to capture highlevel features. However, high-level features, such as sentence structure, are used subconsciously by a writer and thus may be more consistent than surface-level features, such as word choice. In this article, we introduce a new high-level feature based on local syntactic dependencies that an author uses when referring to a named entity (in our case a person's name). The series of experiments in the contexts of movie reviews reveal how the amount of data in both the training and test sets influences predictive performance. Finally, we measure authorship consistency with respect to this new feature and show how consistency influences predictive performance. These results provide other researchers with a new model for how to evaluate new features and suggest that the local syntactic dependencies warrant further investigation. © The Author 2013.

abstract={Internet security issues require authorship identification for all kinds of internet contents; however, authorship identification for microblog users is much harder than other documents because microblog texts are too short. Moreover, when the number of candidates becomes large, i.e., big data, it will take long time to identify. Our proposed method solves these problems. The experimental results show that our method successfully identifies the authorship with 53.2% of precision out of 10,000 microblog users in the almost half execution time of previous method. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The style followed by authors can be thought of as a collection of attributes that defines the stylistics space. Texts from the same author tend to be similar in that space. However, the identification of stylistics spaces has proven to be challenging. Associated with the stylistics space is the authorship attribution task. On it, a text of unknown authorship is presented to a system, and the system is expected to identify the author of the text. Two modules define an authorship attribution algorithm: the stylistics space and a classifier. We present a methodology that includes both, a module that allows the identification of novel stylistics spaces, and a classifier to confront the authorship attribution task from the features that define space. The methodology imbricates feature selection, anomaly detection, classification, and visualization algorithms. We applied the capabilities of self-organizing maps not only for visualization but also for anomaly detection, which defines the basis of the classifier. We compared our authorship attribution algorithm with two existing ones. Our methodology achieved similar or better results under bag-of-words-related stylistics spaces, and it presented the lowest error under a novel stylistics space based on the rate of introduction of new words. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of the author identification task at PAN-2015 evaluation lab. Similar to previous editions of PAN, this shared task focuses on the problem of author verification: given a set of documents by the same author and another document of unknown authorship, the task is to determine whether or not the known and unknown documents have the same author. However, in contrast to the setup of PAN-2013 and PAN-2014, as well as most previous work in this area, it is no longer assumed that all documents match in genre and topic. In other words, we study cross-topic and cross-genre author verification, a challenging, yet realistic, task. A new evaluation corpus was built, covering the four languages Dutch, English, Greek, and Spanish and comprising a variety of genres and topics. A total of 18 teams participated in this task. Following the practice of previous PAN editions, software submissions were required and evaluated within the evaluation-as-a-service platform TIRA. Based on TIRA, we were able to define challenging baseline models using submissions from the corresponding shared tasks at PAN-2013 and PAN-2014. Analytical evaluation results are given, including statistical significance tests. Moreover, we examine the performance of a heterogeneous ensemble that combines all participant models, and we present a comprehensive review of the submitted methods.},

abstract={We describe the approach that we submitted to the 2015 PAN competition [7] for the author identification task1. The task consists in determining if an unknown document was authored by the same author of a set of documents with the same author. We propose a machine learning approach based on a number of different features that characterize documents from widely different points of view. We construct non-overlapping groups of homogeneous features, use a random forest regressor for each features group, and combine the output of all regressors by their arithmetic mean. We train a different regressor for each language. Our approach achieved the first position in the final rank for the Spanish language.},

We combine one-class SVM classifiers under the hypothesis that different categories of features a) are better suited for different authors and b) have different underlying topologies. Thus, we have each classifier operate in a different feature subset with a different kernel function, and the output is used to train a logistic regression model which assigns a different weight to each category of features. Results show that further improvement of the method is needed, and we discuss its shortcomings.},

abstract={The paper describes the problem of authority identification within web discussions solving using linear and nonlinear regression methods. The goal is to find an approximation of dependency of the authority value on variables representing parameters of the structure and particularly the content of selected web discussions. The approximation function can be used at first for computation of the authority value of a given discussant, at second, for discrimination of an authoritative discussant from non-authoritative contributors to the web discussion. This information is important for web users, who search for truthful and reliable information in the process of decision making about important things. The web users would like to be influenced by some credible professionals. The various regression methods were tested. The best solution was implemented in the Application for the Machine Authority Identification. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised authorship verification model called SPATIUM-L1. The suggested strategy can be adapted without any problem to different languages (such as Dutch, English, Greek, and Spanish) with their genre and topic differ significantly. As features, we suggest using the κ most frequent terms of the disputed text (isolated words and punctuation symbols with κ may vary from 200 to 300). Applying a simple distance measure and a set of impostors, we determine whether or not the disputed text was written by the proposed author. Moreover, based on a simple rule, we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer with a high degree of confidence or when the attribution scheme is given without certainty. The evaluations are based on four test collections (PAN AUTHORIDENTIFICATION task at CLEF 2015).},

abstract={Author attribution has grown into an area that is more challenging from the past decade. It has become an inevitable task in many sectors like forensic analysis, law, journalism and many more as it helps to detect the author in every documentation. Here unigram/bigram features along with latent semantic features from word space were taken and the similarity of a particular document was tested using Random forest tree, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine in order to create a global model. Dataset from PAN Author Identification shared task 2014 is taken for processing. It has been observed that the proposed model shows state-of-art accuracy of 80% which is significantly greater when compared to the Author Identification PAN results of the year 2014. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We describe the submission of the Sofia University team for the Author Identification Task, part of the PAN 2015 Challenge. Given a small set of documents by a single person and a "questioned" document, possibly of a different genre and/or topic, the task is to determine whether the questioned document was written by the same person who wrote the known document set. This is a hard but realistic formulation of the task, also known as author verification. We experimented with an SVM classifier using variety of features extracted from publicly available resources. Our solution was among the fastest, and running time was an official evaluation metric; however, our results were not so strong on AUC and C1.},

abstract={Electronic text (e-text) stylometry aims at identifying the writing style of authors of electronic texts, such as electronic documents, blog posts, tweets, etc. Identifying such styles is quite attractive for identifying authors of disputed e-text, identifying their profile attributes (e.g. gender, age group, etc), or even enhancing services such as search engines and recommender systems. Despite the success of Random Forests, its performance has not been evaluated on Author Attribtion problems. In this paper, we present an evaluation of Random Forests in the problem domain of Authorship Attribution. Additionally, we have taken advantage of Random Forests' robustness against noisy features by extracting a diverse set of features from evaluated e-texts. Interestingly, the resultant model achieved the highest classification accuracy in all problems, except one where it misclassified only a single instance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a generic authorship verification scheme for the PAN-2015 identification task. Our scheme uses a two-step training phase on the training corpora. The first phase learns individual feature category parameters as well as decision thresholds based on equal error rates. The second phase builds feature category ensembles which are used for majority vote decisions because ensembles can outperform single feature categories. All feature categories used in our method are very simple to gain multiple advantages: Our method is entirely independent of any external linguistic resources (even word lists), and hence it can easily applied to many languages. Moreover, the classification is very fast due to simple features. Additionally, we make use of parallelization. The evaluation of our scheme on a 40% split (which we did not use for training) of the official PAN- 2015 training corpus led to an average corpus accuracy of 68.12%; in detail 60% for the Dutch, 67.5% for the English, 60% for the Greek and 85% for the Spanish subcorpus. The overall computation runtime was approximately 27 seconds.},

abstract={This article tackles the Authorship Attribution task according to the language independence issue. We propose an alternative of variable length character n-grams features in supervised methods: maximal repeats in strings. When character ngrams are by essence redundant, maximal repeats are a condensed way to represent any substring of a corpus. Our experiments show that the redundant aspect of n-grams contributes to the efficiency of character-based techniques. Therefore, we introduce a new way to weight features in vector based classifier by introducing n-th order maximal repeats (maximal repeats detected in a set of maximal repeats). The experimental results show higher performance with maximal repeats, with less data than n-grams based approach (approximately divided by a factor of 10).},

abstract={Authorship analysis is an important task for different text applications, for example in the field of digital forensic text analysis. Hence, we propose an authorship analysis method that compares the average similarity of a text of unknown authorship with all the text of an author. Using this idea, a text that was not written by an author, would not exceed the average of similarity with known texts and only the text of unknown authorship would be considered as written by the author, if it exceeds the average of similarity obtained between texts written by him. The experiments were realized using the data provided in PAN 2014 competition for Spanish articles for the task of authorship verification. We realize experiments using different similarity functions and 17 linguistics features. We analyze the results obtained with each pair function-features against the baseline of the competition. Additionally, we introduce a text filtering phase that delete all the sample text of an author that are more similar to the samples of other author, with the idea to reduce confusion or non-representative text, and finally we analyze new experiments to compare the results with the data obtained without filtering.},

abstract={This paper presents an overview of the PAN/CLEF evaluation lab. During the last decade, PAN has been established as the main forum of text mining research focusing on the identification of personal traits of authors left behind in texts unintentionally. PAN 2015 comprises three tasks: plagiarism detection, author identification and author profiling studying important variations of these problems. In plagiarism detection, community-driven corpus construction is introduced as a new way of developing evaluation resources with diversity. In author identification, cross-topic and cross-genre author verification (where the texts of known and unknown authorship do not match in topic and/or genre) is introduced. A new corpus was built for this challenging, yet realistic, task covering four languages. In author profiling, in addition to usual author demographics, such as gender and age, five personality traits are introduced (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) and a new corpus of Twitter messages covering four languages was developed. In total, 53 teams participated in all three tasks of PAN 2015 and, following the practice of previous editions, software submissions were required and evaluated within the TIRA experimentation framework. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Previous PAN workshops have offered us the opportunity to explore three different approaches using basic statistics of stopword pairs for author verification. In this PAN, we were able to select our 'best' approach and explore the question of how authors writing about different subjects would necessarily adapt to term lengths specific to the subject. The adaptation required is, essentially, a redistribution of frequency: where longer terms occur. We introduce the notion of a 'topic cost' which increases the propensity for matching. Results show AUC and C1 scores of 0.51, 0.46 and 0.59 for Dutch, Greek and Spanish respectively. The English results are not yet available, as the evaluation system was unable to run the approach due to as yet unknown reasons.},

abstract={The aim of the author attribution is to identify the authorship of an unknown document. Each author has got his unique style of writing pattern, which is the signature (uniqueness) of that author. The present paper derives Histograms of Term Weight Feature (HTWF) model for the authorship attribution. For this the present derived nine Term Features (TF). One of the disadvantage of the histogram models is they derive lot of complexity, especially in author attribution, one has to find out histograms of vast number of terms, out of which 90% of them are non-significant. To address this the present paper derived weights for the TF. A threshold is derived on the average term weight feature to recognize significant terms for the author attribution. This process eliminates the vast number of non-significant words. The present paper for experimented sake considered 148 editorial documents of the seven popular Indian columnists. To analyze the performance of the proposed HTWF model various supervised machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron algorithms ae used. The experimented results indicates the high performance of the present model. © Research India Publications.},

We identified the challenges of this year's are the limited amount of training data and the problems in the sub-corpora are independent in terms of topic and genre. We adopted a machine learning based intrinsic method to verify whether a pair of documents have been written by same or different authors. Several content-independent features, such as function words and stylometric features, were used to capture the difference between documents. Evaluation results on the test corpora show our approach works best on the Spanish data set with 0.7238 and 0.67 for the AUC and C@1 scores respectively.},

abstract={Text Mining has opened a vast array of possibilities concerning automatic information retrieval from large amounts of text documents. A variety of themes and types of documents can be easily analyzed. More complex features such as those used in Forensic Linguistics can gather deeper understanding from the documents, making possible performing difficult tasks such as author identification. In this work we explore the capabilities of simpler Text Mining approaches to author identification of unstructured documents, in particular the ability to distinguish poetic works from two of Fernando Pessoas’ heteronyms: Álvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis. Several processing options were tested and accuracies of 97% were reached, which encourage further developments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Since a language variety contains shared variants, and since a complete correlation between author and linguistic features is rarely acquired, it is suggested that linguistic features which fall outside the correlational agreement in a variety belong to the author's First Person Domain (FPD). Advances in computerized vocabulary profiling and readability provide useful characterization of features found in Academic English (AE), but they cannot capture the full range of linguistic features in a text. A corpus of about 38 extracts and texts (111.000 words) from local and international authors is analyzed to determine interpersonal and intrapersonal variations. The results show that language variation determines the features of FPD which are crucial for author identification and that computational methods are not adequately sensitive to insure a hundred percent author identification. Therefore, epistemological author identity profile (AIP) is suggested to plot alleged texts against the socio-physical and epistemological parameters of alleging authors. © 2015, Australian International Academic Centre PTY LTD.

abstract={Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are very good at modelling the flow of text, but typically need to be trained on a far larger corpus than is available for the PAN 2015 Author Identification task. This paper describes a novel approach where the output layer of a character-level RNN language model is split into several independent predictive sub-models, each representing an author, while the recurrent layer is shared by all. This allows the recurrent layer to model the language as a whole without over-fitting, while the outputs select aspects of the underlying model that reflect their author's style. The method proves competitive, ranking first in two of the four languages.},

abstract={The choice of particular variables for construction of a set of characteristic features relevant to classification can be executed in a kind of external process with respect to a classification system employed in pattern recognition, it can depend on the performance of such system, or it can involve some inherent mechanism, build-in in the system. The three types of approaches correspond to three categories of methodologies typically exploited in feature selection and reduction: filters, wrappers, and embedded solutions, respectively. They are used when domain knowledge is unavailable or insufficient for an informed choice, or in order to support this expert knowledge to achieve higher efficiency, enhanced classification, or reduced sizes of classifiers. The chapter illustrates the combinations of the three approaches with the aim of feature evaluation, for binary classification with balanced, for the task of authorship attribution that belongs with stylometric analysis of texts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Most existing research on authorship attribution uses various types of lexical, syntactic, and structural features for classification. Some of these features are not meaningful for small texts such as email messages. In this paper we demonstrate a very effective use of a syntactic feature of an author’s writing - text’s parse tree characteristics – for authorship analysis of email messages. We define author templates consisting of context free grammar (CFG) production frequencies occurring in an author’s training set of email messages. We then use similar frequencies extracted from a new email message to match against various authors’ templates to identify the best match. We evaluate our approach on Enron email dataset and show that CFG production frequencies work very well and are robust in attributing the authorship of email messages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Authorship analysis is an important task for different text applications, for example in the field of digital forensic text analysis. Hence, we propose an authorship analysis method that compares the average similarity of a text of unknown authorship with all the texts of an author. Using this idea, a text that was not written by an author, would not exceed the average of similarity with known texts and a text of unknown authorship would be considered as written by the author, only if it exceeds the average of similarity obtained between texts written by him and if it got the major value comparing the average similarity with the rest of the authors. For each linguistic feature we obtain a vote by majority using different functions and for the final decision we divide the number of votes for each feature that consider as written by the author the unknown text by the total of features analyzed. The results obtained for each language in the PAN 2015 authorship verification competition are exposed in the overview of the task.},

We consider the task as a supervised classification problem, where each case in a dataset is an instance. Our approach combines the output from multiple learners using basic stacked generalization. The individual learners are obtained using five distinct approaches, each trained using a generic genetic algorithm. Our system performed well on the test set: the macro-average score was 0.61 (2nd best).},

abstract={In this paper, we present a visual analytics based investigation for the task of authorship attribution of the holy Quran with regards to the Hadith Author (the Prophet). This can be seen as an authorship discrimination task between the two religious books: Quran vs Hadith. The first book represents the Divine book written by Allah (God) as claimed by the Prophet Muhammad, whereas the second one represents a collection of certified Prophet's statements. Two visual analytics clustering methods are employed, namely: a Hierarchical Clustering and Fuzzy C-mean Clustering. On the other hand, seven types of NLP features are combined and normalized by PCA reduction before the classification process. The visual analytics results have revealed interesting results in 2D and 3D disposition. In summary, they show two main clusters in both experiments: Quran cluster and Hadith cluster; and the disposition of the resulting clusters corresponds to a clear authorship distinction between the two religious books.},

abstract={The task of (monolingual) text alignment consists in finding similar text fragments between two given documents. It has applications in plagiarism detection, detection of text reuse, author identification, authoring aid, and information retrieval, to mention only a few. We describe our approach to the text alignment subtask of the plagiarism detection competition at PAN 2015. Our method relies on a sentence similarity measure based on a tf-idf-like weighting scheme and cosine and dice similarity measures. We used and extended our previous algorithm for clustering and introduced a new verbatim detection method and extended the decision making regarding which approach or output to use. We improve significantly the performance regarding our previous PAN 2014 approach and hence, our approach outperforms the best-performing system of the PAN 2014. Our system is available open source.},

abstract={Authorship attribution, also known as authorship classification, is the problem of identifying the authors (reviewers) of a set of documents (reviews). The common approach is to build a classifier using supervised learning. This approach has several issues which hurts its applicability. First, supervised learning needs a large set of documents from each author to serve as the training data. This can be difficult in practice. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data. Second, the learned classifier cannot be applied to authors whose documents have not been used in training. In this article, we propose a novel solution to deal with the two problems. The core idea is that instead of learning in the original document space, we transform it to a similarity space. In the similarity space, the learning is able to naturally tackle the issues. Our experiment results based on online reviews and reviewers show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised baseline methods significantly. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Authorship verification using stylometry consists of identifying a user based on his writing style. In this paper, authorship verification is applied for continuous authentication using unstructured online text-based entry. An online document is decomposed into consecutive blocks of short texts over which (continuous) authentication decisions happen, discriminating between legitimate and impostor behaviors. We investigate blocks of texts with 140, 280 and 500 characters. The feature set includes traditional features such as lexical, syntactic, application specific features, and new features extracted from n-gram analysis. Furthermore, the proposed approach includes a strategy to circumvent issues related to unbalanced dataset, and uses Information Gain and Mutual Information as a feature selection strategy and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach based on the Enron email and Twitter corpuses yields very promising results consisting of an Equal Error Rate (EER) varying from 9.98% to 21.45%, for different block sizes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper we report the first authorship attribution results for the Lithuanian language using Internet comments with a thousand of candidate authors. The task is complicated due to the following reasons: large number of candidate authors, extremely short non-normative texts, and problems associated with morphologically and vocabulary rich language. The effectiveness of the proposed similarity-based method was investigated using lexical, morphological, and character features; as well as several dimensionality reduction techniques. Marginally the best results were obtained with the word-level character tetra-grams and entire feature set. However, the technique based on the randomized feature sets even using a few thousands of features achieved very similar performance levels, besides it outperformed method’s implementations based on the sophisticated feature ranking. The best obtained f-score and accuracy values exceeded random and majority baselines by more than 10.9 percentage points. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Character n-grams have been identified as the most successful feature in both singledomain and cross-domain Authorship Attribution (AA), but the reasons for their discriminative value were not fully understood. We identify subgroups of character n-grams that correspond to linguistic aspects commonly claimed to be covered by these features: morphosyntax, thematic content and style. We evaluate the predictiveness of each of these groups in two AA settings: a single domain setting and a cross-domain setting where multiple topics are present. We demonstrate that character ngrams that capture information about affixes and punctuation account for almost all of the power of character n-grams as features. Our study contributes new insights into the use of n-grams for future AA work and other classification tasks. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={Abstract E-mail communication is often abused for conducting social engineering attacks including spamming, phishing, identity theft and for distributing malware. This is largely attributed to the problem of anonymity inherent in the standard electronic mail protocol. In the literature, authorship attribution is studied as a text categorization problem where the writing styles of individuals are modeled based on their previously written sample documents. The developed model is employed to identify the most plausible writer of the text. Unfortunately, most existing studies focus solely on improving predictive accuracy and not on the inherent value of the evidence collected. In this study, we propose a customized associative classification technique, a popular data mining method, to address the authorship attribution problem. Our approach models the unique writing style features of a person, measures the associativity of these features and produces an intuitive classifier. The results obtained by conducting experiments on a real dataset reveal that the presented method is very effective. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={The overwhelming majority of scientific publications are authored by multiple persons; yet, bibliographic metrics are only assigned to individual articles as single entities. In this paper, we aim at a more fine-grained analysis of scientific authorship. We therefore adapt a text segmentation algorithm to identify potential author changes within the main text of a scientific article, which we obtain by using existing PDF extraction techniques. To capture stylistic changes in the text, we adopt a number of stylometric features. We evaluate our approach on a small subset of PubMed articles consisting of an approximately equal number of research articles written by a varying number of authors. Our results indicate that the more authors an article has the more potential author changes are identified. These results can be considered as an initial step towards a more detailed analysis of scientific authorship, thereby extending the repertoire of bibliometrics.},

abstract={With the software inheritance, reuse and piracy becoming more and more common, the software forensics has drawn much more attention increasingly; however, the traditional software similarity detection methods are mainly based on text, grammatical pattern or semantic analyses without deep mining software characteristics. With an attempt to better deal with these problems, this paper proposed the CAR, short for clustering, adjusting and rearranging method as to the software forensics. It focuses on computing the software similarity from the programming characteristics of source codes so as to assist in identifying the software authors by using the clustering algorithm. Experiments proved that whether the comparison of different software versions or the authorship identification of specific software show relativelyidealresults. Consequently, thisproposed method has practical value in the authorship disputes, proof of authorship in court and code re-engineering. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).},

abstract={Sockpuppets are online identities controlled by a user or group of users to manipulate the dissemination of information in digital environments. This manipulation can distort computational assessments of public opinion in social media. Using Russian-language Twitter data from the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, we present a proof-of-concept model employing character n-gram methods to detect sockpuppets. Previous research has demonstrated that n-gram authorship attribution methods can capture lexical preferences, including grammatical and orthographic preferences, while also being less computationally intensive than grammatical or compression language models. Additionally, they can be applied to any language data irrespective of orthography. In this study, a Naïve Bayes classifier was constructed using normalized frequencies of parsed character bigrams to contrast author bigram use. The created model illustrated that suspected sockpuppet accounts were less likely to be correctly classified, showing lower precision, recall, and f-measure rates than other accounts, as predicted. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The peer-review system of most academic conferences relies on the anonymity of both the authors and reviewers of submissions. In particular, with respect to the authors, the anonymity requirement is heavily disputed and pros and cons are discussed exclusively on a qualitative level. In this paper, we contribute a quantitative argument to this discussion by showing that it is possible for a machine to reveal the identity of authors of scientific publications with high accuracy. We attack the anonymity of authors using statistical analysis of multiple heterogeneous aspects of a paper, such as its citations, its writing style, and its content. We apply several multilabel, multiclass machine learning methods to model the patterns exhibited in each feature category for individual authors and combine them to a single ensemble classifier to deanonymize authors with high accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that exploits multiple categories of discriminative features and uses multiple, partially complementing classifiers in a single, focused attack on the anonymity of the authors of an academic publication. We evaluate our author identification framework, deAnon, based on a real-world data set of 3894 papers. From these papers, we target 1405 productive authors that each have at least three publications in our data set. Our approach returns a ranking of probable authors for anonymous papers, an ordering for guessing the authors of a paper. In our experiments, following this ranking, the first guess corresponds to one of the authors of a paper in 39.7% of the cases, and at least one of the authors is among the top 10 guesses in 65.6% of all cases. Thus, deAnon significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for automatic deanonymization. © 2014 IEEE.},

To further improve this understanding and generalisation properties of predictors, the process of selection of decision rules can be executed. The paper presents a post-processing approach to this task.

abstract={Attribution, i.e. a causal explanation for an event or behavior in situations of success or failure, has so far received little attention in HCI research. In this study we investigated whether computer-related attribution styles are related to sociodemographic aspects like age, gender, perceived computer skills and daily computer use. In total 66 participants (17-75 years) were asked to handle solvable (situation of success) and unsolvable (situation of failure) computer tasks. After each task they rated the cause of their success or failure on four attributional dimensions: locus, stability, controllability and globality. By using cluster analysis participants were grouped into three clusters for situations of success and failure, respectively and assigned to one of the six main attribution styles developed in prior research [1]. Finally, we investigated whether attribution styles are related to sociodemographic aspects by calculating Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results showed significant differences between young and elderly persons, whereby elderly persons showed more self-confidence and realism in their attributions than young. We also found significant differences between persons that self-rated their computer skills as poor and advanced. People with advanced skills attribute more often in a resigned style in situations of failure, whereas persons with poor skills attribute more in a confident style. Concerning gender and daily computer use we did not find any significant differences in computer-related attribution styles. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={The task of (monolingual) text alignment consists in finding similar text fragments between two given documents. It has applications in plagiarism detection, detection of text reuse, author identification, authoring aid, and information retrieval, to mention only a few. We describe our approach to the text alignment subtask of the plagiarism detection competition at PAN 2014, which resulted in the best performing system at the PAN 2014 competition and outperforms the best-performing system of the PAN 2013 competition by the cumulative evaluation measure Plagdet. Our method relies on a sentence similarity measure based on a tf-idf-like weighting scheme that permits us to consider stopwords without increasing the rate of false positives. We introduce a recursive algorithm to extend the ranges of matching sentences to maximal length passages. We also introduce a novel filtering method to resolve overlapping plagiarism cases. Our system is available as open source. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Constructing a set with characteristic features for supervised classification is a task which can be considered as preliminary for the intended purpose, just a step to take on the way, yet with its significance and bearing on the outcome, the level of difficulty and computational costs involved, the problem has evolved in time to constitute by itself a field of intense study. We can use statistics, available expert domain knowledge, specialised procedures, analyse the set of all accessible features and reduce them backward, we can examine them one by one and select them forward. The process of sequential selection can be conditioned by the performance of a classification system, while exploiting a wrapper model, and the observations with respect to selected variables can result in assignment of weights and ranking. The chapter illustrates weighting of features with the procedures of sequential backward and forward selection for rule and connectionist classifiers employed in the stylometric task of authorship attribution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={The buzz surrounding Bitcoin has reached a fever pitch. Yet in academic legal discussions, disproportionate emphasis is placed on bitcoins (that is, virtual currency), and little mention is made of blockchain technology-the true innovation behind the Bitcoin protocol. Simply, blockchain technology solves an elusive networking problem by enabling "trustless" transactions: value exchanges over computer networks that can be verified, monitored, and enforced without central institutions (for example, banks). This has broad implications for how we transact over electronic networks. This Note integrates current research from leading computer scientists and cryptographers to elevate the legal community's understanding of blockchain technology and, ultimately, to inform policymakers and practitioners as they consider different regulatory schemes. An examination of the economic properties of a blockchainbased currency suggests the technology's true value lies in its potential to facilitate more efficient digital-asset transfers. For example, applications of special interest to the legal community include more efficient document and authorship verification, title transfers, and contract enforcement. Though a regulatory patchwork around virtual currencies has begun to form, its careful analysis reveals much uncertainty with respect to these alternative applications. © 2015 Trevor I. Kiviat.},

abstract={This is a comparative study to empirically investigate the performances of three different procedures for calculating authorship attribution likelihood ratios (LR). The procedures to be compared are: 1) a procedure based on multivariate kernel density (MVKD) with lexical features; 2) a procedure based on word N-grams; and 3) a procedure based on character N-grams. Furthermore, the best-performing LRs of these three procedures are fused into combined single LRs using a logistic-regression fusion, in order to investigate the extent of the improvement/deterioration that the fusion brings about. This study uses chatlog messages, which were presented as evidence to prosecute paedophiles, for testing. The numbers of word tokens used to model the authorship attribution of each message group are 500 and 1000 words. This was done to examine the effect of sample size on the performance of a system. The performance of a system is assessed with regard to its validity (= accuracy) and reliability (= precision) using the log-likelihood-ratio cost (Cllr) and 95% credible intervals (CI), respectively. While describing the different characteristics of these three procedures in their outcomes, this study demonstrates that the MVKD procedure was the best-performing procedure out of the three in terms of Cllr. This study also demonstrates that a logistic-regression fusion is useful for combining the LRs obtained from the three procedures in question, resulting in a good improvement in performance. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Identification of environmental hotspots becomes a pressing issue for companies pursuing sustainable supply chain management. In particular, excessive dependence on water resources outside the country may put the supply chain at unanticipated risk of water shortage. This article presents a practical approach to screening potential environmental hotspots of different impact categories that occur in the supply chain using environmental input-output analysis. First, the amounts of domestic and foreign potential impacts of global warming, terrestrial acidification, and water resource consumption, induced through supply chains were calculated for 403 sectors of Japanese products. Thereafter, with a focus on potential impacts induced through the import of raw materials, a framework for screening foreign potential hotspots was presented. The results showed that the sectoral potential impacts of water resource consumption had high rates of foreign impacts at deeper tiers of the supply chains for some sectors, which indicated that there exist hidden water hotspots outside the country. In the case study of fiber yarns, impacts on water resource consumption induced as a result of the import of crops, as well as that induced in silviculture as a result of the import of wood chips, were found to be the foreign potential hotspots. © 2015 by the authors.},

abstract={Dedicated funds for open access (OA) publishing have been a strategic instrument at German university libraries for many years. As the number of OA publications grows dynamically, the question arises as to whether the processes of handling article processing charges (APCs) are being sustainably organized among libraries and publishers so as to enable a full transition to OA. The Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) processes about 600 invoices for OA articles per year centrally on behalf of Max Planck researchers. This paper describes the individual steps required in order to assume charges centrally as well as the barriers emerging during this process. It is shown that the main desiderata for the establishment of smooth and scalable processes are the optimization of article submission systems, better author identification and assignment, and improved reporting. © 2015 Adriana Sikora and Kai Geschuhn.},

abstract={The Internet provides an ideal anonymous channel for concealing computer-mediated malicious activities, as the network-based origins of critical electronic textual evidence (e.g., emails, blogs, forum posts, chat logs, etc.) can be easily repudiated. Authorship attribution is the study of identifying the actual author of the given anonymous documents based on the text itself, and for decades, many linguistic stylometry and computational techniques have been extensively studied for this purpose. However, most of the previous research emphasizes promoting the authorship attribution accuracy, and few works have been done for the purpose of constructing and visualizing the evidential traits. In addition, these sophisticated techniques are difficult for cyber investigators or linguistic experts to interpret. In this article, based on the End-to-End Digital Investigation (EEDI) framework, we propose a visualizable evidence-driven approach, namely VEA, which aims at facilitating the work of cyber investigation. Our comprehensive controlled experiment and the stratified experiment on the real-life Enron email dataset demonstrate that our approach can achieve even higher accuracy than traditional methods; meanwhile, its output can be easily visualized and interpreted as evidential traits. In addition to identifying the most plausible author of a given text, our approach also estimates the confidence for the predicted result based on a given identification context and presents visualizable linguistic evidence for each candidate. © 2015 ACM 1094-9224/2015/03-ART12 $15.00.},

abstract={The statistical analysis of the heterogeneity of the style of a text often leads to the analysis of contingency tables of ordered rows. When multiple authorship is suspected, one can explore that heterogeneity through either a change-point analysis of these rows, consistent with sudden changes of author, or a cluster analysis of them, consistent with authors contributing exchangeably, without taking order into consideration. Here an analysis is proposed that strikes a compromise between change-point and cluster analysis by incorporating the fact that parts close together are more likely to belong to the same author than parts far apart. The approach is illustrated by revisiting the authorship attribution of Tirant lo Blanc. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Identification of nonlinear systems is one of the important problems in engineering. Chaotic systems are among those nonlinear systems that have been in the center of attention of many researchers because of their complex and unpredictable behaviors. This paper proposes an algorithm for optimally estimating the parameters of system by minimizing the mean of squared errors (MSE) index. In this paper, Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is used for solving both offline and online parameter estimation problems for chaotic systems. The validity of this algorithm in terms of convergence speed and parameter accuracy in comparison to other popular optimization algorithms such as Standard PSO (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is shown through an illustrative example for the modeling of chaotic systems. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of this algorithm, it is applied to the problem of parameter identification of a well-known nonlinear Lorenz chaotic system. According to simulation results, the proposed algorithm is a very suitable algorithm for online parameter identification for a class of nonlinear chaotic systems. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Abstract Compiler provenance encompasses numerous pieces of information, such as the compiler family, compiler version, optimization level, and compiler-related functions. The extraction of such information is imperative for various binary analysis applications, such as function fingerprinting, clone detection, and authorship attribution. It is thus important to develop an efficient and automated approach for extracting compiler provenance. In this study, we present BinComp, a practical approach which, analyzes the syntax, structure, and semantics of disassembled functions to extract compiler provenance. BinComp has a stratified architecture with three layers. The first layer applies a supervised compilation process to a set of known programs to model the default code transformation of compilers. The second layer employs an intersection process that disassembles functions across compiled binaries to extract statistical features (e.g., numerical values) from common compiler/linker-inserted functions. This layer labels the compiler-related functions. The third layer extracts semantic features from the labeled compiler-related functions to identify the compiler version and the optimization level. Our experimental results demonstrate that BinComp is efficient in terms of both computational resources and time. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={At present very large volumes of information are being regularly produced in the world. Most of this information is unstructured, lacking the properties usually expected from, for instance, relational databases. One of the more interesting issues in computer science is how, if possible, may we achieve data mining on such unstructured data. Intuitively, its analysis has been attempted by devising schemes to identify patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. The basic problem of this approach is that the user has to decide, a priori, the model of the patterns and, furthermore, the way in which they are to be found in the data. This is true regardless of the kind of data, be it textual, musical, financial or otherwise. In this paper we explore an alternative paradigm in which raw data is categorized by analyzing a large corpus from which a set of categories and the different instances in each category are determined, resulting in a structured database. Then each of the instances is mapped into a numerical value which preserves the underlying patterns. This is done using a genetic algorithm and a set of multi-layer perceptron networks. Every categorical instance is then replaced by the adequate numerical code. The resulting numerical database may be tackled with the usual clustering algorithms. We hypothesize that any unstructured data set may be approached in this fashion. In this work we exemplify with a textual database and apply our method to characterize texts by different authors and present experimental evidence that the resulting databases yield clustering results which permit authorship identification from raw textual data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={This work aims at enriching author profiles with additional information to better support search and retrieval of publications across different digital libraries. To achieve this objective we exploit concepts for cross-linking data to identify correlations between one author and other authors, publications or other related information. We will introduce a profile enrichment approach which adds additional information (e.g. biographic information) from different sources to existing author profiles. Within this context, the linked open data repository DBpedia serves a valuable source for our profile enrichment approach. Still, one of several challenges in this context is the identification of the same author in different sources. To address this challenge we will exploit VIAF (virtual authority file) for author identification. Technically we apply data mining and clustering techniques to uniquely identify authors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

It seeks to verify the hypothesis, recently reproposed by Tomasz Jasinski, whereby the author was of Venetian origin. The hypothesis is namely based on the textual similarities observed between Translatio Sancti Nicolai by an author referred to as the 'Monk of Lido' (Monachus Littorensis) and the Chronica. The attribution attempt put forth by M. Eder is based upon stylometric methods that measure the frequencies of the most frequent words in the texts under research (mainly, conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns, and particles) which are subsequently subjected to cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, or principal components analysis. The outcome of the experiment in question has demonstrated a strong resemblance between the Translatio Sancti Nicolai and the Polish Chronicle, which may be regarded as an substantial argument in support of the Venetian background hypothesis.},

abstract={This article presents a mathematical and empirical verification of computational constancy measures for natural language text. A constancy measure characterizes a given text by having an invariant value for any size larger than a certain amount. The study of such measures has a 70-year history dating back to Yule’s K, with the original intended application of author identification. We examine various measures proposed since Yule and reconsider reports made so far, thus overviewing the study of constancy measures. We then explain how K is essentially equivalent to an approximation of the second-order Rényi entropy, thus indicating its signification within language science. We then empirically examine constancy measure candidates within this new, broader context. The approximated higher-order entropy exhibits stable convergence across different languages and kinds of text. We also show, however, that it cannot identify authors, contrary to Yule’s intention. Lastly, we apply K to two unknown scripts, the Voynich manuscript and Rongorongo, and show how the results support previous hypotheses about these scripts. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={In this study, the accuracy of the Author ID (author identification) in the Scopus bibliographic database was evaluated. For this purpose,weadopted theKAKENdatabase as the source of ‘‘correct data’’. KAKEN is an open database and is the biggest funding database in Japan because it manages all the information of the largest public fund for academic researchers. In the KAKEN database, each researcher has a unique Researcher Number, which must be used when a proposal or annual report is submitted to the database. Thus, the concordance between each researcher and the associated Researcher Number is checked automatically and constantly. For this reason, we used this number to evaluate the Scopus Author ID. After matching bibliographic records between Scopus and KAKEN, we calculated recall and precision of the Scopus Author ID for Japanese researchers. We found that recall and precision were around 98 and 99%respectively. This result showed the Author ID, though not perfectly accurate in terms of individual identification, was reliable enough to be used as a new tool for bibliometrics.We hope that academic researchers outside Japan will also evaluate the accuracy of the Scopus Author ID as a tool to uniquely identify individual researchers. © 2015, Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={Objectives: The aim of the paper is to examine the efficiency of using of parts-of-speech (POS) bigram frequencies to address the problem of personality prediction from text. Methods/Analysis: 96 texts were used for the study which were randomly selected from a corpus of Russian students' essays "Personality". Using NLP methods frequencies of POS bigrams in each text (227 types of bigrams were overall identified) were computed, bigrams were then selected which are found in no less than 75% of the analyzed texts. Correlations between POS bigrams frequencies in texts and author gender and personality traits are computed. Findings: Some researchers report consistently positive contribution of POS n-grams in construction of models for personality prediction from text. But these conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of English-language texts. Our finding confirms the efficiency of POS bigrams in predicting personality from texts in Russian. Correlations of POS bigrams frequencies and characteristics of the authors of the texts (gender, personality traits measured with McCrae and Costa questionnaire) were computed. Gender was correlated with frequency of prep_noun bigram in the text, males typically score more on this parameter. For neuroticism the correlations were identified with adj-noun, noun-prep, prep-noun bigrams. There were also correlations with the Openness parameter and frequencies of noun-prep bigram. There were also weak correlations between the scores on Extraversion and frequencies of pers-vfin bigram, the scores on Agreeableness and frequencies of pers-vfin bigrams and ptcl-vfin bigrams. The paper points out that the resulting dependencies should be interpreted based on psychology, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics data. Novelty of the study: To our knowledge, the current study has been the first one to deal with the frequencies of certain POS bigrams as parameters for written text author profiling for Russian-language texts. Conclusion/Application: The study conducted on Russian texts confirmed early finding in English regarding usefulness of POS n-grams in author profiling task.

abstract={In this chapter, we discuss a novel biometric trait, called cognitive biometrics. It is defined as the process of identifying an individual through extracting and matching unique signatures based on the cognitive, affective, and conative state of that individual. Currently, there is an increasing need for novel biometric systems that engage multiple modalities because of the changing notion of privacy in today's world. Also, cognitive biometrics will become essential as pervasive computing becomes more prevalent, where computing can happen anywhere and anytime. The use of cognitive traits for biometrics is relatively underexplored in the research community. We study whether the cognitive state of a person can be learned and used as a soft biometric trait and discuss our large-scale experimental setup, which yielded encouraging results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: In this systematic review, the authors review studies of rural colonoscopy to determine specialty types providing rural colonoscopy and the quality of these procedures. Methods: A systematic MEDLINE search was conducted for articles pertaining to rural colonoscopy. Inclusion criteria were rural location, report of quality outcomes, or report of endoscopy workforce in rural areas. Two investigators independently reviewed and abstracted included articles. The following information was obtained from each study: author identification, citation, study design, source of funding, study duration and follow-up, study population, sample size, study setting, population characteristics, outcomes and results. Standard abstraction forms were used to summarize and assess the quality of evidence. Results: From 121 articles in the MEDLINE search, 11 met inclusion criteria. One additional article found from a reference list was included. Eleven articles from three countries reported on 8703 colonoscopies performed by 25 rural generalists. Reach-thececum rates (RCR) ranged from 36% to 96.5% with more recent studies showing higher RCRs. Adenoma detection rates ranged from 16.6% to 46%. The rate of complications was low in all studies. One study of the rural endoscopist workforce reported that general surgeons performed most rural colonoscopies in Canada. Conclusions: Rural generalist physicians can safely and effectively perform colonoscopies. More research is needed on the rural endoscopist workforce. © DV Evans, AM Cole, TE Norris, 2015.},

abstract={Native language identification (NLI) is the task of automatically identifying the first language (L1) of a language user on the basis of the person's production of the target language. This research pursuit is guided by the assumption that a person's L1 background can be inferred from how frequently he or she makes use of certain features of the target language (e.g. words, word sequences, sequences of characters). The task is typically modelled as a text categorisation problem where the set of L1s is predefined and each text is assigned an L1 on account of its specific language features. NLI offers potential practical applications in a wide variety of domains that rely on language corpora. Among other benefits, NLI appears to enhance the performance of a number of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as speech recognition, parsing and information extraction (Mayfield Tomokiyo and Jones 2001). NLP tools and techniques are typically trained on native-speaker data and are consequently often less robust when applied to non-native language (L2) (Díaz-Negrillo et al. 2010; Chapter 24, this volume). A second benefit of NLI is that its results may contribute to the success of machine-learning approaches to author identification and profiling. These techniques are today of crucial interest for a number of web-related fields such as internet security and cybercrime investigation (Argamon et al. 2009). The results of an NLI task may also contribute to second language acquisition (SLA) theory building. The ability to detect the L1 of individuals on the basis of their use of certain specific features of the target language indeed offers unprecedented opportunities for the study of transfer, i.e. ‘the influence resulting from similarities and differences between the target language and any other language that has been previously (and perhaps imperfectly) acquired’ (Odlin 1989: 27; see also Chapter 15, this volume). The rapprochement between NLI techniques and transfer research was first made by Tsur and Rappoport (2007) and has recently been fully articulated in the detection-based approach to transfer (Jarvis 2010, 2012). In this exploratory approach, the results of an NLI task are used as primary data to investigate the nature and extent of L1 influence in non-native language use. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},
